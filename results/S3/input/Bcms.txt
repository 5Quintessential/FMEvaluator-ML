Basic features along with desired variations are proposed such that it results in a small SPL definition. The primary focus of the proposed variations is to allow for static and dynamic variations (i.e., dynamic change between variants  at  runtime).  The  software  product  line  is  described  in  the  following  manner:  the specification  of  a  "reference  variant"  of  the  SPL  referred  to  as  bCrash  is  first  provided;  in  a specific section, we then include all the information concerning possible variations that could be applied to bCrash. In this way, all the variation points and their possible implementations are introduced.  bCrash-SPL serves to illustrate the individual advantages and disadvantages of aspect-oriented modeling  (AOM)  and  object-oriented  modeling  (OOM)  approaches  at  the  Workshop  on Comparing Modeling Approaches (CMA) to be held at Models 2011. The CMA workshop will bring  together  practitioners  of  different  modeling  approaches  including  AOM  and  OOM approaches to discuss and evaluate their various approaches in the context of the bCrash-SPL and provided comparison criteria. Practitioners can choose to either specify the bCrash-SPL or to  focus  on  the  bCrash  variant  only.  In  either  case,  the  modeling  community  is  invited  to demonstrate  their  approaches  on  the  entire  bCrash  system  or  on  the  entire  bCrash-SPL,  thus providing  a  basis  for  discussion,  comparison,  and  evaluation.  For  the  bCrash-SPL,  not  all variations have to be modeled depending on their priority (see the beginning of Section 7 for more details on the priorities of variations).  While  there  are  many  AOM  approaches,  from  requirements  to  low-level  design,  it  is  still difficult  to  compare  them  and  know  under  which  conditions  different  approaches  are  most applicable. This comparison, however, is crucially important to unify existing AOM and more traditional OOM approaches and to generalize individual approaches into a comprehensive end- to-end method. Such a method that spans from early requirements to low-level design and that includes validation does not yet exist, and it is not readily evident how such a method would actually  work  in  practice.  As  part  of  identifying  potential  comprehensive  methodologies,  we must be able to evaluate on a focused example different AOM approaches with each other and also against more traditional OOM approaches, and apply the same criteria to each approach. The comparison criteria will be made available on the CMA workshop website well before the CMA workshop is held.  Experiences with the original case study crisis management system2 indicate that a large scope for the case study leads to different researchers exploring different parts of the system. When different  parts  of  a  system  are  modeled  using  different  approaches,  it  becomes  difficult  to compare these approaches. Hence, while the  bCrash-SPL is  based  on the  original, it is  much more focused and comprises only one use case, a few non-functional requirements, and a few variations.  The approach chosen in this requirements document is rather "agnostic", thus we tried both in terms of terminology used and document structure followed to be as "clergy independent" as   1The 'b' of bCrash stands for Barbados, the country to which this case study is historically related, but also for the second version of the car crash crisis management system. 2  Kienzle,  J.,  Guelfi,  N.,  Mustafiz,  S.  (2010)  Crisis  Management  Systems:  A  Case  Study  for  Aspect- Oriented  Modeling.  Katz,  S.,  Mezini,  M.,  Kienzle,  J.  (eds.)  Transactions  on  Aspect-Oriented  Software Development VII, LNCS 6210, pp 1-22, DOI: 10.1007/978-3-642-16086-8_1.    3    possible. The abstraction and completeness levels chosen are supposed to be sufficient to reach our main goal as described above.  We suppose that the execution of the services of any product line variant may be concurrent. This will depend on the constraints on the execution order described for each service definition. Nevertheless, we do not use any modeling notation to this aim and the concerned constraints are hence spread over the textual descriptions3.  This document introduces first the scope and stakeholders of the system in Sections 2 and 3, respectively. Then, the functional and non-functional requirements are specified in Sections 4 and  5,  respectively.  While  Section  6  discusses  hardware  and  standards,  Section  7  highlights proposed variation points. The document concludes with a data dictionary in Section 8 and a glossary in Section 9.  2  Scope The  bCrash  system  is  a  distributed  crash  management  system  that  is  responsible  for coordinating the communication between a fire station coordinator (FSC) and a police station coordinator (PSC) to handle a crisis in a timely manner (see Figure 1). Internal communication among the police personnel (including the PSC) is outside the scope of the desired system. The same assumption applies to the fire personnel (including the FSC). Information regarding the crisis as it pertains to the tasks of the coordinators will be updated and maintained during and after the crisis.     Figure 1: Overall view of the environment and the desired system.   There  are  two  collaborative  sub-systems.  Thus,  the  global  coordination  is  the  result  of  the parallel  composition  of  the  (software)  coordination  processes  controlled  by  the  two  (human) distributed  coordinators  (i.e.,  PSC  and  FSC).  There  is  no  central  database;  fire  and  police stations maintain separate databases and may only access information from the other database through  the  bCrash  system.  Each  coordination  process  is  hence  in  charge  of  adding  and updating information in its respective database.  For  simplicity,  the  context  of  the  bCrash  system  is  an  accident  involving  an  overturned  oil tanker  on  a  highway,  where  the  tanker  is  on  fire.  The  actual  execution  of  the  mission  (e.g., rescue  victims  or  remove  obstacles)  is  outside  the  scope  of  the  bCrash  system  except  for  3mainly in the use case scenario descriptions    4    specific  information  about  the  mission  as  required  by  the  coordinators.  This  information includes  the  crisis  details  and  the  route  plan  as  defined  in  the  data  dictionary  in  Section  8. Furthermore,  the  current  version  of  the  bCrash  system  assumes  that  sufficient  resources  are available (e.g., fire trucks). Finally, there is only one fire station and only one police station and only one crisis at a time.  The  bCrash  system  starts  operating  at  the  point  when  a  given  crisis  has  been  detected  and declared  both  at  the  fire  station  and  the  police  station,  independently.  The  coordinators  (i.e., PSC and FSC) have already defined the parameters necessary to start handling the crisis. The initial emergency call of a witness and any subsequent notifications of the crisis from additional witnesses through either the police station and/or fire station call centers are outside the scope of the desired system.  A  number  of  policies  exist  governing  the  timing  for  actions  to  be  completed,  the  number  of vehicles  to  be  deployed  for  different  types  of  crises,  etc.  The  development  and  compliance checking of these policies are outside the scope of the desired system.  Any  variation  of  the  system  detailed  in  Section  7  may  be  either  selected  at  design  time  or activated at run time.  3  Stakeholders All  stakeholders  of  the  system  are  detailed  in  this  section.  After  a  brief  description  of  a stakeholder, the objectives of the stakeholder are first stated. Thereafter, the responsibilities of the  stakeholder  are  detailed  which  help  to  achieve  the  stakeholder’s  objectives  to  a  certain degree. While the objectives characterize the general problems addressed by the bCrash system, the  responsibilities  describe  concrete  actions  that  are  expected  from  a  stakeholder.  Some  of these responsibilities can be traced to the use case in Section 4, and hence must be supported by the bCrash system. Responsibilities that cannot be traced to the use case are outside the scope of the system. All stakeholders listed in this section have an interest in the system or are affected by the system in some way, but only a subset of the stakeholders are directly involved in the use case described in Section 4.  3.1  Fire Station Coordinator (FSC) A  FSC  maintains  control  over  a  crisis  situation  by  communicating  with  the  police  station coordinator (PSC) as well as firemen.  The objectives of a FSC are:   In order to achieve these objectives, the responsibilities of a FSC are: to determine where, when, and how many fire trucks to send, to communicate with the PSC to introduce herself, to keep PSC up to date regarding the nature of the crisis and the deployed resources,  5    to handle a crisis efficiently and effectively (e.g., minimize loss or injury to people and property), to get resources to the crisis location in the shortest amount of time, to have accurate estimation of resource needs and time of arrivals for resources, to have effective negotiation skills (e.g., with other coordinators), to have dependable communication with involved stakeholders, to maintain a feeling of control over the crisis (e.g., minimize stress level by providing and receiving crisis information to and from other coordinators in a timely fashion), and to provide clear, executable instructions to appropriate staff.   to propose a strategy for handling the crisis, to reach an agreement with the PSC on how to proceed, to receive updates regarding the crisis from individual firemen, and to collate and distribute updated information and instructions back to the firemen.   3.2  Fireman A fireman acts on orders received from the FSC and reports crisis-related information back to the FSC. Furthermore, a fireman communicates with other firemen, victims, and witnesses at the crisis location.  The objectives of a fireman are:    to stay alive, to minimize injury, to save and support the victim, to minimize damage to property, to work well in a team, to have confidence in the coordinator and follow instructions well, and to keep up to date regarding the crisis situation.   In order to achieve these objectives, the responsibilities of a fireman are:  to receive requests to go to/return from the crisis location, to report location status to FSC, to report conditions of the crisis to FSC and all firemen, and to communicate with the victim and the witness at the crisis location.   3.3  Police Station Coordinator (PSC) A  PSC  maintains  control  over  a  crisis  situation  by  communicating  with  the  fire  station coordinator (FSC) as well as policemen.  The objectives of a PSC are the same as the objectives of a FSC.  In  order  to  achieve  these  objectives,  a  PSC  performs  the  same  activities  as  a  FSC.  The description  in  Section  3.1  hence  applies  except  that  fire  trucks  are  replaced  with  police  cars, PSC with FSC, and firemen with policemen.  3.4  Police Officer A  police  officer  acts  on  orders  received  from  the  PSC  and  reports  crisis-related  information back to the PSC. Furthermore, a police officer communicates with other policemen, victims, and witnesses at the crisis location.  The  objectives  of  a  police  officer  are  the  same  as  the  objectives  of  a  fireman.  In  addition,  a police officer wants to re-establish order disturbed by a crisis (e.g., manage traffic and people).  In order to achieve these objectives, a police officer performs the same activities as a fireman in terms  of  communicating  with  his  coordinator.  Hence,  the  description  in  section  3.2  applies except that FSC is replaced with PSC.     6    3.5  Victim A victim has been adversely affected by the crisis and may communicate with policemen and firemen.  The objectives of a victim are:  to be rescued in the shortest amount of time, to recover from injuries and/or loss in the shortest amount of time, to minimize stress caused by the crisis, to be informed of crisis status as it impacts the victim, and to know what to do at different stages of the crisis.   In order to achieve these objectives, the responsibilities of a victim are:                        to  provide  crisis-related  information  (including  information  about  their  location, identity, and medical history) to firemen and policemen, and to follow instructions from firemen and policemen.   3.6  Witness (at the crisis location) A witness has observed the crisis and communicates with policemen and firemen.  The objectives of a witness are:  to provide accurate information about the crisis to the police and fire personnel, and to know what to do.   In order to achieve these objectives, the responsibilities of a witness are:  to provide information to firemen and policemen, and to follow instructions from firemen and policemen.   3.7  Government Agencies Government  agencies  provide  funding  for  the  system  and  expect  improvements  of  the communities’ living standard from the deployment of the system.  The objectives of a government agency are:  to keep the community safe, and to ensure effective response times with minimal costs.   In order to achieve these objectives, the responsibilities of a government agency are:  to provide funding for fire and police departments, and to establish policies for both groups (e.g., security, response time expectations).   3.8  Communication Compromiser  A  communication  compromiser  wants  to  achieve  personal  gain,  whether  it  is  monetary  or otherwise,  by  accessing  confidential  information  and  disrupting  the  handling  of  the  crisis situation.  The objectives of a communication compromiser are:    to disrupt the response to the crisis for some personal gain.   In order to achieve these objectives, the actions of a communication compromiser are:    7      to gain access to confidential information, to change confidential information, and to disrupt communications.   4  Functional Requirements This section details the use case of the bCrash system. Underlined items are further defined in the data dictionary in Section 8.  Use Case: Communicate with Other Coordinator  Actors: Goal:  PSC, FSC To  resolve  a  crisis  situation  as  quickly  and  cost-effectively  as  possible  in cooperation  with  other  coordinator.  Coordination  is  required  as  police  may enable  fire  personnel  to  reach  the  crisis  location faster  (e.g.,  by escorting  the fire trucks or by creating roadblocks).  Precondition:  PSC and FSC are aware  of crisis, but have  not established  contact with  each  other.   Main Scenarios:  1.  PSC and FSC establish communication and identification of coordinators. 2.  PSC and FSC exchange crisis details. 3.  PSC  and  FSC  develop  a  coordinated  route  plan  in  a  timely  fashion  for  number  of  vehicles to be deployed to specific locations with respective ETAs.  3.1. PSC and FSC state their respective number of fire trucks and police vehicle to  3.2. PSC proposes one route for fire trucks and one route for police vehicles to reach  deploy.  crisis site.  3.3. FSC agrees to route.  4.  PSC  and  FSC  communicate  to  each  other  that  their  respective  vehicles  have  been  dispatched according to plan (per vehicle).  5.  PSC and FSC communicate to each other their arrival (per vehicle) at targeted locations. 6.  PSC and FSC communicate to each other completion (per vehicle) of their respective  objectives.  7.  PSC and FSC agree to close the crisis.   Alternative and Exceptional Scenarios: At step 3 when the duration of the negotiation exceeds a predefined limit:  3.a1.  A timeout is recorded in the system. 3.a2.  PSC and FSC are alerted that a timeout has occurred for completing the negotiation. 3.a3.  PSC and FSC are allowed to continue with the sub-step of step 3 where the timeout         occurred. In parallel to 3.a3, PSC and FSC report the reason for timeout.  3.a4.   At step 3.3 when the FSC disagrees with the proposed route:  3.3.a1.  The PSC removes the proposed route from the possible routes. 3.3.a2.  Continue with step 3.2.   At step 3.3.a2 when there is no more route left to be proposed:  3.3.a2.a1.  The  PSC  informs  the  FSC  that  the  route  will  not  be  coordinated  and  that  updates of vehicle locations and crisis details are still to be exchanged.  3.3.a2.a2.  Continue with step 4.  8    At step 5 when a police vehicle/fire truck does not reach its destination within the ETA because of vehicle break down:  5.a1.  The PSC/FSC informs the other coordinator of the new ETA and, if necessary, that  a replacement vehicle is on its way.  5.a2.  Continue with step 5.   At step 5 when a police vehicle/fire truck does not reach its destination within the ETA because of traffic or blocked routes:  5.b1.  Continue with step 3.   At step 5 when the crisis is more severe than expected:  5.c1.  Continue with step 3.   At step 5 when the crisis is less severe than expected:  vehicles/fire trucks, respectively.  5.d2.  Continue with step 5.   At any step M when communication is not available:  5.d1.  The  PSC/FSC  informs  the  other  coordinator  of  recall  of  one  or  more  police  M.a1.  PSC and FSC continue to address the crisis individually, and both will coordinate through  their  personnel  once  their  personnel  have  reached  the  crisis  site  (this resolution is out of scope for bCrash).   At  any  step  N  when  communication  has  been  restored  after  a  period  of  unavailable communication:  7.a1.  7.a2.  7.a3.  7.a4.  7.a5.  If  the  crisis  has  been  resolved  (i.e.,  the  objectives  of  all  vehicles  have  been reached), then continue with step 7. If communication between PSC and FSC has not yet been established (step 1 has not yet been reached), then continue with step 1. If  the  route  agreement  has  been  reached  (the  use  case  is  between  step  4  and  6, inclusive),  then  exchange  information  on  routes  established  for  police  and  fire, location of vehicles, and status of crisis and for each vehicle continue with step 4, 5, or 6 depending on the location of a vehicle. If  the  route  agreement  has  not  been  reached  and  the  time  limit  for  the  route negotiation has not yet expired (the use case is between step 2 and 3.2, inclusive), then continue with step N. If  the  route  agreement  has  not  been  reached  and  the  time  limit  for  the  route  has expired  (the  use  case  is  between  step  3.1  and  3.2,  inclusive),  then  exchange information on routes established for police and fire, location of vehicles, and status of crisis and for each vehicle continue with step 4, 5, or 6 depending on the location of a vehicle.   5  Non-Functional Requirements This section briefly discusses three non-functional requirements. Underlined items are further defined in the data dictionary in Section 8.     9    5.1  Integrity The system shall ensure that the integrity of the communication between coordinators regarding crisis location, vehicle number, and vehicle location is preserved 99.99%4 of the time. The systems shall ensure that the integrity of all other data transmitted between the coordinators is preserved 95% of the time.  5.2  Availability The  crisis  details  and  route  plan  of  the  fire  station  and  the  police  station,  as  well  as  the information related to the identification of the coordinators shall be available with the exception of a total of 5 minutes during the time period when at least one crisis is active. The crisis details and route plan of the fire station and the police station shall be available with the exception of a total of 30 minutes for every 48 hours when no crisis is active.  5.3  Performance The system shall respond to user requests within 5 seconds 95% of the time. The system shall respond to user requests within 30 seconds 99.99% of the time.  6  Hardware and Standards The FSC and PSC shall use their computer with a wired connection to a T1 link to communicate with each other. Communication between the FSC and PSC shall use the https Internet protocol.  7  Variations The purpose of this document is to define the requirements for the bCrash-SPL. The approach chosen for describing the SPL is to define and detail the possible variations points that could be applied to the “reference variant” bCrash, which is described in the previous sections.  Desired variations are proposed that result in a small SPL definition. The primary focus is to allow  for  static  and  dynamic  variations  (i.e.,  dynamic  change  between  variants  at  runtime). Nonetheless, it is important to understand that a set of variants is not a variant of the SPL. For example, a software having several configuration modes, which might be changed dynamically, may  be  either  a  variant  of  a  SPL  or  an  implementation  of  a  SPL  framework  with  a  variant derivation capability implemented using configuration means.  The variations proposed are structured into two categories: functional in Section 7.1 and non- functional in Section 7.2. Furthermore, for each variation two priorities are defined – one for requirements models and one for design models. A priority may either be “must have” (i.e., the variation must be part of the model) or “may have”. In the latter case, an ordering of variations is specified (i.e., if a “may have” variation with number N is part of the model, then all other “may have” variations with a number smaller than N must also be part of the model).  Table 1: Priorities of Variations   4The  numbers  provided  in  the  section  on  non-functional  requirements  do  not  aim,  of  course,  at  being realistic  and  are  not  based  on  empirical  studies.  They  are  here  to  request  the  coverage  of  this  type  of requirement.    10     Variation Police and Fire Stations Multiplicity  must have must have Vehicles Management Vehicles Management must have Communication Protocol Crisis Multiplicity Confidentiality of Data Communication Authentication of System's Users Communication Layer  must have must have  must have must have  Requirements Priority  Design Priority  must have may have (#1) may have (#2)  must have must have  may have (#3) may have (#4)   7.1  Functional Requirements Variations 7.1.1  Police and Fire Stations Multiplicity Variation point: Multiplicity of Police Stations (PS) and Fire Stations (FS) Variations:  1.  one PS and one FS 2.  many PS and many FS Constraints: exclusive variants Comment(s):  In  this  requirement  document,  the  situation  with  a  single  PSC  and  FSC  was described. Based on performance and/or budget constraints as well as changes to policies, fire station and police station management may be restructured, leading to more than one PSC/FSC. In this case, a lead coordinator may be required; he may change over the duration of the crisis.  7.1.2  Vehicles Management Introduction of a dispatching service to provide the ability to send and receive messages to/from police vehicles, fire trucks, and citizen vehicles.  Variation point: Vehicles Management Variations:  1.  PSC  and  FSC  cannot  send  to  and  receive  messages  from  police  vehicles  and  citizen  2.  Only  the  PSC  can  send  to  and  receive  messages  from  police  vehicles  and  citizen  vehicles.  vehicles.  3.  Only the FSC can send to and receive messages from fire station trucks. 4.  Both PSC and FSC can send routing information to their respective vehicles. 5.  PSC can receive notification of accidents from citizen vehicles.  Constraints:  i.  Variant 1 is exclusive with the other variants. ii.  Variant 4 implies variant 2 and 3. iii.  Variant 5 includes variant 2.  Comment(s): This variation point will impact the steps 4, 5, and 6 of the use case described in Section 4.  7.1.3  Vehicles Management Communication Protocol In  case  the  system  offers  the  functionality  of  communication  between  PSC/FSC  and  their respective  vehicles,  the  infrastructure  of  this  communication  should  fulfill  the  following requirements:     11    Variation point: Vehicle Communication Protocol Variations:  1.  The messaging infrastructure uses SOAP over the Internet. 2.  The messaging infrastructure uses a simple SSL security mechanism.  Constraints: AND variants  i.  This variation point requires variants 2, 3, 4, or 5 of variation point 7.1.2.  Comment(s):  This  variation  point  impacts  the  same  steps  of  the  use  case  from  Section  4  as variation point 7.1.2.  7.1.4  Crisis Multiplicity In  this  document,  we  assume  that  the  bCrash  system  can  handle  only  one  crisis  at  a  time. Complex crisis management systems may handle several crisis at a time, from possibly different domains. This is expressed by this variation point.  Variation point: Crisis Multiplicity Variations:  1.  single crisis 2.  multiple crisis  Constraints: exclusive variants Comment(s):  A  multi  crisis  system  needs  to  integrate  (when  needed)  crisis  identification.  It must be also possible to route vehicles from crisis location to another crisis location. As there are multiple crisis, each crisis needs to be uniquely identified and has its own particular set of data (GPS location, type, status, etc.). The system needs to manage and keep track of all this information.  The  scenario  described  in  section  4  applies  to  each  individual  crisis.  Thus,  the system will have to manage the execution of several scenarios (one for each crisis) in parallel.  7.2  Non-Functional Requirements Variations 7.2.1  Confidentiality of Data Communication Variation point: Confidentiality of Data Communication Variations:  1.  encrypted communications 2.  non-encrypted communications  Constraints: exclusive variants Comment(s): This type of variation impacts the functioning of the system in multiple places, as it applies every time there is a data communication between actors of the system. For example, in the use case described in Section 4, this variation points impacts steps 1-7.  7.2.2  Authentication of System's Users Variation point: Authentication of System's Users Variations:  1.  password based 2.  certificate based 3.  biometrics based 4.  one time password (i.e., RSA secured ID) 5.  challenge response (i.e., symmetric cryptographic based/mutual authorization/Kerberos) Constraints:  each  variant  might  include  zero  or  any  combination  of  the  listed  variations concerning the authentication of users.    12    Comment(s):  In  the  scenario  described  in  Section  4,  the  authentication  of  the  PSC  and  FSC takes place at step 1. However, user authentication may be required at different places within the system's scenario.  7.2.3  Communication Layer Variation  point:  Communication  Protocol  used  for  Communication  Between  Actors  and System. Variations:  1.  Proprietary communication protocol (used over a private network) 2.  HTTP 3.  SOAP  Constraints:  i.  Variant 1 is exclusive with the other variants. ii.  Variants 2 and 3 can co-exist in a same variant, either applied to different actors or even  for the same actor.  Comment(s):  The  scenario  described  in  Section  4  corresponds  to  variation  1.  However,  the chosen  communication  layer  should  not  have  an  impact  on  the  analysis  phase  of  the  bCrash system. Conversely, it may have a deep impact on the design of the desired system.  8  Data Dictionary Crisis Details:  ID, ETA, and location (station, enrouteToLocation, atLocation, enrouteReturn) of each police vehicle  Number of fire trucks  Route (path to reach the location) for each police vehicle and each fire truck  ID, ETA, and location (same as above) of each fire truck  Identifier   Location (GPS) Time Status (Active, Closed) Description   Route Plan:  Crisis ID Number of police vehicles    Timeout Log:  Crisis ID Time Date Reason PSC Reason FSC   9  Glossary Term AOM bCrash  Definition Aspect-oriented Modeling The name of a bCrash-SPL “reference variant”.
