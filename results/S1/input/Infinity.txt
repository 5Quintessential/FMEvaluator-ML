2019 OWNER’S MANUAL

AND MAINTENANCE INFORMATION

For your safety, read carefully and keep in this vehicle.

CALIFORNIA PROPOSITION 65 WARNING

WARNING

Operating, servicing and maintaining a passenger
vehicle or off-highway motor vehicle can expose you to
chemicals including engine exhaust, carbon monoxide,
phthalates, and lead, which are known to the State of
California to cause cancer and birth defects or other
reproductive harm. To minimize exposure, avoid
breathing exhaust, do not idle the engine except as
necessary, service your vehicle in a well-ventilated area
and wear gloves or wash your hands frequently when
servicing your vehicle. For more information go to
www.P65Warnings.ca.gov/passenger-vehicle.

Foreword

This manual was prepared to help you
understand the operation and maintenance
of your vehicle so that you may enjoy many
miles (kilometers) of driving pleasure. Please
read through this manual before operating
your vehicle.
A separate Warranty Information Booklet
is included in your Owner’s literature port-
folio. Always carry it with you when you
take your vehicle to an INFINITI retailer.
The Warranty Information Booklet con-
tents provide complete information about
all warranties covering this vehicle, the
requirements to keep the warranties in
effect as well as the INFINITI Roadside
Assistance program.
Additionally, a separate Customer Care and
Lemon Law Information Booklet will ex-
plain how to resolve any concerns you may
have with your vehicle, as well as clarify
your rights under your state’s lemon law.
In addition to factory installed options, your
vehicle may also be equipped with additional
accessories installed by INFINITI or by your
INFINITI retailer prior to delivery.
It is
important that you familiarize yourself with
all disclosures, warnings, cautions and in-
structions concerning proper use of such
accessories prior to operating the vehicle
and/or accessory. It is recommended you
visit an INFINITI retailer for details concern-

ing the particular accessories with which
your vehicle is equipped.

READ FIRST — THEN DRIVE
SAFELY
Before driving your vehicle, read your Own-
er’s Manual carefully. This will ensure famil-
iarity with controls and maintenance
requirements, assisting you in the safe
operation of your vehicle.

WARNING

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
REMINDERS!

Follow these important driving rules to
help ensure a safe and comfortable trip
for you and your passengers!
. NEVER drive under the influence of

alcohol or drugs.

. ALWAYS observe posted speed lim-
its and never drive too fast for
conditions.

. ALWAYS give your full attention to
driving and avoid using vehicle fea-
tures or taking other actions that
could distract you.

. ALWAYS use your seat belts and
appropriate child restraint systems.

Pre-teen children should be seated in
the rear seat.

. ALWAYS provide information about
the proper use of vehicle safety
features to all occupants of the
vehicle.

. ALWAYS review this Owner’s Man-
ual for important safety information.

ON-PAVEMENT AND OFF-
ROAD DRIVING
This vehicle will handle and maneuver
differently from an ordinary passenger car
because it has a higher center of gravity
for off-road use. As with other vehicles
with features of this type, failure to
operate this vehicle correctly may result in
loss of control or an accident. Be sure to
read “On-pavement and off-road driving
precautions”, “Avoiding collision and roll-
over” and “Driving safety precautions” in
the “5. Starting and driving” section of this
manual.

MODIFICATION OF YOUR VEHI-
CLE
This vehicle should not be modified. Mod-
ification could affect its performance,
safety or durability, and may even violate
governmental regulations. In addition, da-
mage or performance problems resulting
from modification will not be covered
under the INFINITI warranties.

WARNING

Installing an aftermarket On-Board Di-
agnostic (OBD) plug-in device that uses
the port during normal driving, for
example remote insurance company
monitoring, remote vehicle diagnostics,
telematics or engine reprogramming,
may cause interference or damage to
vehicle systems. We do not recommend
or endorse the use of any aftermarket
OBD plug-in devices, unless specifically
approved by INFINITI. The vehicle war-
ranty may not cover damage caused by
any aftermarket plug-in device.

WHEN READING THE MANUAL
This manual
includes information for all
features and equipment available on this

duction, region or availability. Therefore,
you may find information about features or
equipment that are not included or installed
on your vehicle.
All
information, specifications and illustra-
tions in this manual are those in effect at the
time of printing. INFINITI reserves the right
to change specifications, performance, de-

SEATS

leave children, people who require the
assistance of others or pets unat-
tended in your vehicle. Additionally,
the temperature inside a closed ve-
hicle on a warm day can quickly
become high enough to cause a sig-
nificant risk of injury or death to
people and pets.

. The seatback should not be reclined
any more than needed for comfort.
Seat belts are most effective when
the passenger sits well back and
straight up in the seat. If the seat-
back is reclined, the risk of sliding
under the lap belt and being injured is
increased.

WARNING

. Do not ride in a moving vehicle when
the seatback is reclined. This can be
dangerous. The shoulder belt will not
be against your body. In an accident,
you could be thrown into it and
receive neck or other serious injuries.
You could also slide under the lap belt
and receive serious internal injuries.
. For the most effective protection
when the vehicle is in motion, the
seat should be upright. Always sit
well back and upright in the seat with

FRONT-SEAT ACTIVE HEAD RE-
STRAINT
The Active Head Restraint moves forward
utilizing the force that the seatback receives
from the occupant in a rear-end collision.
The movement of the head restraint helps
support the occupant’s head by reducing its
backward movement and helping absorb
some of the forces that may lead to
whiplash-type injuries.
Active Head Restraints are effective for
collisions at low to medium speeds in which
it is said that whiplash injury occurs most.
Active Head Restraints operate only in
certain rear-end collisions. After the colli-

original position.
Adjust the Active Head Restraints properly
as described earlier in this section.

SEAT BELTS

PRECAUTIONS ON SEAT BELT
USAGE
If you are wearing your seat belt properly
adjusted, and you are sitting upright and well
back in your seat with both feet on the floor,
your chances of being injured or killed in an
accident and/or the severity of injury may be
greatly reduced.
INFINITI strongly en-
courages you and all of your passengers to
buckle up every time you drive, even if your
seating position includes a supplemental air
bag.
Most U.S. states and Canadian provinces or
territories specify that seat belts be worn at
all times when a vehicle is being driven.

1-18 Safety — seats, seat belts and supplemental restraint system

WARNING

. Every person who drives or rides in
this vehicle should use a seat belt at
all times. Children should be properly
restrained in the rear seat and,
if
appropriate, in a child restraint.

. The seat belt should be properly
adjusted to a snug fit. Failure to do
so may reduce the effectiveness of
the entire restraint system and in-
crease the chance or severity of injury
in an accident. Serious injury or death
can occur if the seat belt is not worn
properly.

. Always route the shoulder belt over
your shoulder and across your chest.
Never put the belt behind your back,
under your arm or across your neck.
The belt should be away from your
face and neck, but not falling off your
shoulder.

. Position the lap belt as low and snug
as possible AROUND THE HIPS, NOT
THE WAIST. A lap belt worn too high
could increase the risk of internal
injuries in an accident.

. Be sure the seat belt tongue is
securely fastened to the proper
buckle.

. All seat belt assemblies,

including
retractors and attaching hardware,
should be inspected after any colli-
sion. It is recommended you visit an
INFINITI retailer for this service.
INFINITI recommends that all seat
belt assemblies in use during a colli-
sion be replaced unless the collision
was minor and the belts show no
damage and continue to operate
properly. Seat belt assemblies not in
use during a collision should also be
inspected and replaced if either da-
mage or improper operation is noted.
. All child restraints and attaching
hardware should be inspected after
any collision. Always follow the re-
straint manufacturer’s inspection in-
s t r u c t i o n s a n d r e p l a c e m e n t
recommendations. The child re-
straints should be replaced if they
are damaged.

. Do not wear the seat belt inside out
or twisted. Doing so may reduce its
effectiveness.

. Do not allow more than one person to

use the same seat belt.

. Never carry more people in the ve-

.

hicle than there are seat belts.
If the seat belt warning light glows
continuously while the ignition is
turned ON with all doors closed and
all seat belts fastened, it may indicate
a malfunction in the system. Have the
system checked. It is recommended
you visit an INFINITI retailer for this
service.

. No changes should be made to the
seat belt system. For example, do not
modify the seat belt, add material or
install devices that may change the
seat belt routing or tension. Doing so
may affect the operation of the seat
belt system. Modifying or tampering
with the seat belt system may result
in serious personal injury.

. Once a seat belt pretensioner has
activated, it cannot be reused and
must be replaced together with the
retractor. It is recommended you visit
an INFINITI retailer for this service.

PREGNANT WOMEN
INFINITI recommends that pregnant women
use seat belts. The seat belt should be worn
snug, and always position the lap belt as low
as possible around the hips, not the waist,
and place the shoulder belt over your
shoulder and across your chest. Never run
the lap/shoulder belt over your abdominal
area. Contact your doctor for specific re-
commendations.

INJURED PERSONS
INFINITI recommends that injured persons
use seat belts, depending on the injury.
Check with your doctor for specific recom-
mendations.

PRE-CRASH SEAT BELTS WITH
COMFORT FUNCTION (if so
equipped for front seats)
The pre-crash seat belt tightens the seat belt
with a motor to help restrain front seat
occupants. This helps reduce the risk of
injury in a collision.
The motor retracts the seat belt under the
following emergency conditions:
. During emergency braking
. During sudden steering maneuvers
. Activation of the Forward Emergency
Braking (FEB) with pedestrian detection

system. (See “Forward Emergency Brak-
ing (FEB) with pedestrian detection”
(P.5-100).)
In the event of a high severity rollover
collision.

.

The pre-crash seat belt will not be active
when:
.
.

the seat belt is not fastened
the vehicle speed is under 10 MPH (15
km/h) during emergency braking
the vehicle speed is under 19 MPH (30
km/h) during sudden steering maneuvers
or in the event of a high severity rollover
collision.

.

The pre-crash seat belt will not be active
when the brake pedal
is not depressed
except when sudden steering maneuvers
occur or the Forward Emergency Braking
(FEB) with pedestrian detection system
activates.
The motor also retracts the seat belt when
the seat belt is fastened or unfastened.
When the seat belt is fastened, the motor
tightens the seat belt for a snug fit. When
the seat belt is unfastened, the motor
retracts the seat belt. If the seat belt is not
fully retracted, the motor retracts the seat
belt when the door is opened.
Always wear your seat belt correctly and sit
upright and well back.

If the motor cannot retract the seat belt
when the seat belt is fastened or unfas-
tened, it may indicate the pre-crash seat belt
system has a malfunction. Have the system
checked and repaired. It is recommended you
visit an INFINITI retailer for this service.
When the seat belt is retracted repeatedly in
a short period of time, the motor may not be
able to retract the seat belt. After 8 minutes,
the motor reactivates and retracts the seat
belt. If the seat belt still cannot be retracted
by the motor, the pre-crash seat belt system
has a malfunction. Have the system checked
and repaired. It is recommended you visit an
INFINITI retailer for this service.

THREE-POINT TYPE SEAT BELT

WARNING

. Every person who drives or rides in
this vehicle should use a seat belt at
all times.

. Do not ride in a moving vehicle when
the seatback is reclined. This can be
dangerous. The shoulder belt will not
be against your body. In an accident,
you could be thrown into it and
receive neck or other serious injuries.
You could also slide under the lap belt
and receive serious internal injuries.

the seat belt retracts and becomes tight.
This can occur even if the vehicle is
parked. Unbuckle the seat belt to release
the child. For the center of the 3rd row
bench seat, the connector tongue may
also be released. Release the connector

When the ALR mode is activated the seat
belt cannot be extended again until the seat
belt tongue is detached from the buckle and
fully retracted. The seat belt returns to the
ELR mode after the seat belt fully retracts.
For additional
information, see “Child re-
straints” (P.1-31).
The ALR mode should be used only for child
restraint installation. During normal seat
belt use by an occupant, the ALR mode
should not be activated. If it is activated, it
may cause uncomfortable seat belt tension.

WARNING

When fastening the seat belts, be certain
that seatbacks are completely secured in
the latched position.
If they are not
completely secured, passengers may be
injured in an accident or sudden stop.

Fastening the seat belts
1. Adjust the seat. (See “Seats” (P.1-3).)
2. Slowly pull the seat belt out of the
retractor and insert the tongue into the
buckle until you hear and feel the latch
engage.
. The retractor is designed to lock
during a sudden stop or on impact.
A slow pulling motion permits the
belt to move, and allows you some
freedom of movement in the seat.
If the seat belt cannot be pulled from
its fully retracted position, firmly pull
the belt and release it. Then smoothly
pull the belt out of the retractor.

.

3. Position the lap belt portion low and

snug on the hips as shown.

4. Pull the shoulder belt portion toward the

the shoulder belt is routed over your
shoulder and across your chest.

The three-point type seat belts have two
modes of operation:
. Emergency Locking Retractor (ELR)
. Automatic Locking Retractor (ALR)
The Emergency Locking Retractor (ELR)
mode allows the seat belt to extend and
retract to allow the driver and passengers
some freedom of movement in the seat. The

. The shoulder belt anchor height
should be adjusted to the position
best for you. Failure to do so may
reduce the effectiveness of the entire
restraint system and increase the
chance or severity of injury in an
accident.

SEAT BELT EXTENDERS
If, because of body size or driving position, it
is not possible to properly fit the lap-
shoulder belt and fasten it, an extender that
is compatible with the installed seat belts is
available that can be purchased. The ex-
tender adds approximately 8 in (200 mm) of
length and may be used for either the driver
or front passenger seating position.
It is
recommended you visit an INFINITI retailer
for assistance with purchasing an extender if
an extender is required.

.

It is recommended that only INFINITI
seat belt extenders, made by the
same company which made the origi-
nal equipment seat belts, be used
with the INFINITI seat belts.

. Adults and children who can use the
standard seat belt should not use an
extender. Such unnecessary use could
result in serious personal injury in the
event of an accident.

. Never use seat belt extenders to
install child restraints.
If the child
restraint is not secured properly, the
child could be seriously injured or
killed in a collision or a sudden stop.

SEAT BELT MAINTENANCE
. To clean the seat belt webbing, apply a
mild soap solution or any solution re-
commended for cleaning upholstery or
carpets. Then, wipe with a cloth and
allow the seat belts to dry in the shade.
Do not allow the seat belts to retract
until they are completely dry.
If dirt builds up in the shoulder belt guide
of the seat belt anchors, the seat belts
may retract slowly. Wipe the shoulder

JVR0183X

WARNING

Do not allow children to play with the
seat belts. Most seating positions are
equipped with Automatic Locking Re-
tractor (ALR) mode seat belts. If the seat
belt becomes wrapped around a child’s
neck with the ALR mode activated, the
child can be seriously injured or killed if
the seat belt retracts and becomes tight.
This can occur even if the vehicle is
parked. Unbuckle the seat belt to release
the child. For the center of the 3rd row
bench seat, the connector tongue may
also be released. Release the connector

tongue by inserting a suitable tool (such
. If
as a key) into the connector buckle
the seat belt cannot be unbuckled or is
already unbuckled, release the child by
cutting the seat belt with a suitable tool
(such as a knife or scissors) to release the
seat belt.

Children need adults to help protect them.
They need to be properly restrained.
In addition to the general information in this
manual, child safety information is available
from many other sources, including doctors,
teachers, government traffic safety offices,
and community organizations. Every child is
different, so be sure to learn the best way to
transport your child.
There are three basic types of child restraint
systems:
. Rear-facing child restraint
. Forward-facing child restraint
. Booster seat
The proper restraint depends on the child’s
size. Generally, infants up to about 1 year
and less than 20 lbs (9 kg) should be placed
in rear-facing child restraints. Forward-
facing child restraints are available for
children who outgrow rear-facing child re-
straints and are at least 1 year old. Booster
seats are used to help position a vehicle lap/

shoulder belt on a child who can no longer
use a forward-facing child restraint.

WARNING

Infants and children need special protec-
tion. The vehicle’s seat belts may not fit
them properly. The shoulder belt may
come too close to the face or neck. The
lap belt may not fit over their small hip
bones.
In an accident, an improperly
fitting seat belt could cause serious or
fatal
injury. Always use appropriate
child restraints.

All U.S. states and Canadian provinces or
territories require the use of approved child
restraints for infants and small children. See
“Child restraints” (P.1-31).
A child restraint may be secured in the
vehicle by using either the LATCH (Lower
Anchor and Tethers for CHildren) system or
with the vehicle seat belt. See “Child re-
straints” (P.1-31) for more information.
INFINITI recommends that all pre-teens and
children be restrained in the rear seat.
Studies show that children are safer when
properly restrained in the rear seat than in
the front seat.
This is especially important because your

Standards. You should choose a child re-
straint that fits your vehicle and always
follow the manufacturer’s instructions for
installation and use.

INFANTS
Infants up to at least 1 year old should be
placed in a rear-facing child restraint.
INFINITI recommends that infants be placed
in child restraints that comply with Federal
Motor Vehicle Safety Standards or Cana-
dian Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. You
should choose a child restraint that fits your
vehicle and always follow the manufac-
turer’s instructions for installation and use.

SMALL CHILDREN
Children that are over 1 year old and weigh
at least 20 lbs (9 kg) should remain in a rear-
facing child restraint as long as possible up
to the height or weight limit of the child
restraint. Children who outgrow the height
or weight limit of the rear-facing child
restraint and are at least 1 year old should
be secured in a forward-facing child re-
straint with a harness. Refer to the manu-
facturer’s instructions for minimum and
maximum weight and height recommenda-
tions. INFINITI recommends that small chil-
dren be placed in child restraints that comply
with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Stan-
dards or Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety

LARGER CHILDREN
Children should remain in a forward-facing
child restraint with a harness until they reach
the maximum height or weight limit allowed
by the child restraint manufacturer.
Once a child outgrows the height or weight
limit of the harness-equipped forward-fa-
cing child restraint, INFINITI recommends
that the child be placed in a commercially
available booster seat to obtain proper seat
belt fit. For a seat belt to fit properly, the
booster seat should raise the child so that
the shoulder belt is properly positioned
across the chest and the top, middle portion
of the shoulder. The shoulder belt should not
cross the neck or face and should not fall off
the shoulder. The lap belt should lie snugly
across the lower hips or upper thighs, not the
abdomen.
A booster seat can only be used in seating
positions that have a three-point type seat
belt. The booster seat should fit the vehicle
seat and have a label certifying that it
complies with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety
Standards or Canadian Motor Vehicle
Safety Standards.

PRECAUTIONS ON CHILD RE-
STRAINTS

WARNING

. Failure to follow the warnings and
instructions for proper use and in-
stallation of child restraints could
result in serious injury or death of a
child or other passengers in a sudden
stop or collision:
— The child restraint must be used
and installed properly. Always
follow all of the child restraint
manufacturer’s instructions for
installation and use.

— Infants and children should never
be held on anyone’s lap. Even the
strongest adult cannot resist the
forces of a collision.

— Do not put a seat belt around
both a child and another passen-
ger.

— INFINITI recommends that all
child restraints be installed in the
rear seat. Studies show that chil-
dren are safer when properly re-
strained in the rear seat than in
the front seat. If you must install a

If you answered no to any of these ques-
tions, the child should remain in a booster
seat using a three-point type seat belt.

NOTE:
Laws in some communities may follow
different guidelines. Check local and state
regulations to confirm your child is using the
correct restraint system before traveling.

WARNING

Never let a child stand or kneel on any
seat and do not allow a child in the cargo
area. The child could be seriously injured
or killed in a sudden stop or collision.

forward-facing child restraint in
the front seat, see “Forward-
facing child restraint installation
using the seat belts” (P.1-44).

— Even with the INFINITI Advanced
Air Bag System, never install a
rear-facing child restraint in the
front seat. An inflating air bag
could seriously injure or kill a child.
A rear-facing child restraint must
only be used in the rear seat.

— Be sure to purchase a child re-
straint that will fit the child and
vehicle. Some child restraints may
not fit properly in your vehicle.

— Child restraint anchor points are
designed to withstand loads from
child restraints that are properly
fitted.

— Never use the anchor points for

adult seat belts or harnesses.

— A child restraint with a top tether
strap should not be used in the
front passenger seat.

— Keep seatbacks as upright as
possible after fitting the child
restraint.

— Infants and children should al-
ways be placed in an appropriate

child restraint while in the vehicle.
. When the child restraint is not in use,
keep it secured with the LATCH
system or a seat belt. In a sudden
stop or collision,
loose objects can
injure occupants or damage the ve-
hicle.

CAUTION

A child restraint in a closed vehicle can
become very hot. Check the seating
surface and buckles before placing a
child in the child restraint.

This vehicle is equipped with a universal child
restraint anchor system, referred to as the
LATCH (Lower Anchors and Tethers for
CHildren) system. Some child restraints in-
clude rigid or webbing-mounted attach-
ments that can be connected to these
anchors.
For details, see “Lower Anchors and Tethers
for CHildren System (LATCH)” (P.1-33).
If you do not have a LATCH compatible child
restraint, the vehicle seat belts can be used.
Several manufacturers offer child restraints
for infants and small children of various
sizes. When selecting any child restraint,

.

keep the following points in mind:
. Choose only a restraint with a label
certifying that it complies with Federal
Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 213 or
Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Stan-
dard 213.

. Check the child restraint in your vehicle to
be sure it is compatible with the vehicle’s
seat and seat belt system.
If the child restraint is compatible with
your vehicle, place your child in the child
restraint and check the various adjust-
ments to be sure the child restraint is
compatible with your child. Choose a
child restraint that is designed for your
child’s height and weight. Always follow
all recommended procedures.
If the combined weight of the child and
child restraint is less than 65 lbs (29.5
kg), you may use either the LATCH lower
anchors or the seat belt to install the
child restraint (not both at the same
time).
If the combined weight of the child and
child restraint is greater than 65 lbs (29.5
kg), use the vehicle’s seat belt (not the
lower anchors) to install the child re-
straint.

. Be sure to follow the child restraint
manufacturer’s instructions for installa-
tion.

WARNING

Failure to follow the warnings and
instructions for proper use and installa-
tion of child restraints could result in
serious injury or death of a child or other
passengers in a sudden stop or collision:
. Attach LATCH system compatible
child restraints only at the locations
shown in the illustration.

. Do not secure a child restraint in the
center rear seating position using the

straint will not be secured properly.
Inspect the lower anchors by insert-
ing your fingers into the lower anchor
area. Feel to make sure there are no

.

obstructions over the anchors such as
seat belt webbing or seat cushion
material. The child restraint will not
be secured properly if the lower
anchors are obstructed.

Child restraint anchorages are designed
to withstand only those loads imposed
by correctly fitted child restraints. Under
no circumstances are they to be used to
attach adult seat belts, or other items or
equipment to the vehicle. Doing so could
damage the child restraint anchorages.
The child restraint will not be properly
installed using the damaged anchorage,
and a child could be seriously injured or
killed in a collision.

FORWARD-FACING CHILD RE-
STRAINT INSTALLATION USING
THE SEAT BELTS

WARNING

. The three-point seat belt with Auto-
matic Locking Retractor (ALR) must
be used when installing a child re-
straint. Failure to use the ALR mode
will result in the child restraint not
being properly secured. The restraint
could tip over or be loose and cause
injury to a child in a sudden stop or
collision. Also,
it can change the
operation of the front passenger air
bag. See “Front passenger air bag
and status light” (P.1-60)

. When installing a child restraint sys-
tem in the 3rd center position, both
the center seat belt connector tongue
and buckle tongue must be secured.
See “3rd row center seat belt” (P.1-
25).

Forward-facing (front passenger seat) —

step 1

Refer to all Warnings and Cautions in the
“Child safety” and “Child restraints” sections
before installing a child restraint.
Do not use the lower anchors if the com-
bined weight of the child and the child
restraint exceeds 65 lbs (29.5 kg). If the
combined weight of the child and the child
restraint is greater than 65 lbs (29.5 kg), use
the vehicle’s seat belt (not the lower an-
chors) to install the child restraint. Be sure to
follow the child restraint manufacturer’s
instructions for installation.
Follow these steps to install a forward-
facing child restraint using the vehicle seat
belt in the rear seats or in the front

passenger seat:
1.

If you must install a child restraint in the
front seat,
it should be placed in a
forward-facing direction only. Move
the seat to the rearmost position. Child
restraints for infants must be used in the
rear-facing direction and, therefore,
must not be used in the front seat.

2. Position the child restraint on the seat.
Always follow the child restraint manu-
facturer’s instructions.
The back of the child restraint should be
secured against the vehicle seatback.
If necessary, adjust or remove the head
restraint or headrest to obtain the
correct child restraint fit.
If the head
restraint or headrest is removed, store it
in a secure place. Be sure to reinstall the
head restraint or headrest when the
child restraint is removed. See “Head
restraints/headrests” (P.1-13) for head
restraint or headrest adjustment, re-
moval and installation information.
If the seating position does not have an
adjustable head restraint or a headrest
and it is interfering with the proper child
restraint fit, try another seating position
or a different child restraint.

4. Pull the shoulder belt until the belt is fully
extended. At this time, the seat belt
retractor is in the Automatic Locking
Retractor (ALR) mode (child restraint
mode). It reverts to Emergency Locking
Retractor (ELR) mode when the seat belt
is fully retracted.

3. Route the seat belt tongue through the
child restraint and insert it into the buckle
until you hear and feel the latch engage.
Be sure to follow the child restraint
manufacturer’s instructions for belt
routing.
If the child restraint is equipped with a
top tether strap, route the top tether
strap and secure the tether strap to the
tether anchor point (rear seat installation
only). See “Installing top tether strap”
(P.1-48). Do not install child restraints
that require the use of a top tether strap
in seating positions that do not have a
top tether anchor.

the belt.

6. Remove any additional slack from the
seat belt; press downward and rearward
firmly in the center of the child restraint
with your knee to compress the vehicle
seat cushion and seatback while pulling
up on the seat belt.

7. Tighten the tether strap according to the
manufacturer’s instructions to remove
any slack.

8. After attaching the child restraint, test it
before you place the child in it. Push it
from side to side while holding the child
restraint near the seat belt path. The
child restraint should not move more
than 1 inch (25 mm), from side to side.
Try to tug it forward and check to see if
the belt holds the restraint in place. If the
restraint is not secure, tighten the seat
belt as necessary, or put the restraint in
another seat and test it again. You may
need to try a different child restraint. Not
all child restraints fit in all types of
vehicles.

9. Check to make sure the child restraint is
properly secured prior to each use. If the

BOOSTER SEATS

Precautions on booster seats

WARNING

If a booster seat and seat belt are not
used properly, the risk of a child being
injured in a sudden stop or collision
greatly increases:
. Make sure the shoulder portion of
the belt is away from the child’s face
and neck and the lap portion of the
belt does not cross the stomach.

. Make sure the shoulder belt is not
behind the child or under the child’s
arm.

. A booster seat must only be installed
in a seating position that has a lap/
shoulder belt.

SUPPLEMENTAL RESTRAINT SYSTEM

PRECAUTIONS ON SUPPLE-
MENTAL RESTRAINT SYSTEM
This Supplemental Restraint System (SRS)
section contains important information con-
cerning the following systems.
. Driver and passenger supplemental
front-impact air bag (INFINITI Advanced
Air Bag System)

. Front seat-mounted side-impact supple-

mental air bag

. Roof-mounted curtain side-impact and

rollover supplemental air bag

. Seat belt with pretensioner
Supplemental front-impact air bag system:
The INFINITI Advanced Air Bag System can
help cushion the impact force to the head
and chest of the driver and front passenger
in certain frontal collisions.
Front seat-mounted side-impact supple-
mental air bag system: This system can help
cushion the impact force to the chest and
pelvis area of the driver and front passenger
in certain side impact collisions. The supple-
mental side air bag is designed to inflate on
the side where the vehicle is impacted.
Roof-mounted curtain side-impact and roll-
over supplemental air bag system: This
system can help cushion the impact force
to the head of occupants in front and rear
(2nd and 3rd) outboard seating positions in

certain side impact or rollover collisions. In a
side impact, the curtain air bags are designed
to inflate on the side where the vehicle is
impacted. In a rollover, the curtain air bags
on both sides are designed to inflate. Under
both side-impact and rollover situations, the
curtain air bags will remain inflated for a
short period of time.
These supplemental restraint systems are
designed to supplement the crash protection
provided by the driver and passenger seat
belts and are not a substitute for them. Seat
belts should always be correctly worn and
the occupant seated a suitable distance
away from the steering wheel, instrument
panel and door finishers. (See “Seat belts”
(P.1-18) for instructions and precautions on
seat belt usage.)
The supplemental air bags operate only
when the ignition switch is in the ON
position.
After pushing the ignition switch to the ON
position, the supplemental air bag warning
light illuminates. The supplemental air bag
warning light will turn off after about 7
seconds if the systems are operational.

1-52 Safety — seats, seat belts and supplemental restraint system

WARNING

. The supplemental front air bags or-
dinarily will not inflate in the event of
a side impact, rear impact, rollover, or
lower severity frontal collision. Al-
ways wear your seat belts to help
reduce the risk or severity of injury in
various kinds of accidents.

. The front passenger air bag will not
inflate if the front passenger air bag
status light is lit or if the front
passenger seat is unoccupied. See
“Front passenger air bag and status
light” (P.1-60).

. The seat belts and the front air bags
are most effective when you are
sitting well back and upright in the
seat. The front air bags inflate with
great force. Even with the INFINITI
Advanced Air Bag System, if you are
unrestrained, leaning forward, sitting
sideways or out of position in any
way, you are at greater risk of injury
or death in a crash. You may also
receive serious or fatal injuries from
the front air bag if you are up against
it when it inflates. Always sit back
against the seatback and as far-away
as practical from the steering wheel
or instrument panel. Always use the

SSS0131

SSS0132

seat belts.

. The driver and front passenger seat
belt buckles are equipped with sen-
sors that detect if the seat belts are
fastened. The Advanced Air Bag
System monitors the severity of a
collision and seat belt usage then
inflates the air bags. Failure to prop-
erly wear seat belts can increase the
risk or severity of injury in an acci-
dent.

. The front passenger seat is equipped
with occupant classification sensors
(weight sensors) that turn the front
passenger air bag OFF under some
conditions. This sensor is only used in
this seat. Failure to be properly
seated and wearing the seat belt
can increase the risk or severity of
injury in an accident. See “Front
passenger air bag and status light”
(P.1-60).

. Keep hands on the outside of the
steering wheel. Placing them inside
the steering wheel rim could increase
the risk of injury if the front air bag
inflates.

. The seat belts, the side air bags and
curtain air bags are most effective
when you are sitting well back and
upright in the seat. The side air bags
and curtain air bags inflate with
great force. Do not allow anyone to
place their hand, leg or face near the
side air bags on the side of the
seatback of the front seat or near
the side roof rails. Do not allow
anyone sitting in the front seats or
rear outboard seats to extend their
hand out of the window or lean
against the door. Some examples of
dangerous riding positions are shown
in the previous illustrations.

. When sitting in the rear seat, do not
hold onto the seatback of the front
seat. If the side air bag inflates, you
may be seriously injured. Be espe-
cially careful with children, who
should always be properly restrained.

bag may deploy in a collision. Also the
front passenger air bag status light
may not illuminate. See “Child re-
straints” (P.1-31) for information
about installing and using child re-
straints.

.

. Confirm the operating condition with
the front passenger air bag status
light.
If you notice that the front passenger
air bag status light is not operating in
accordance with the above descrip-
tion, it is recommended you visit an
INFINITI retailer to check the pas-
senger seat advanced air bag system.
. Until you have confirmed with your
retailer that your passenger seat
advanced air bag is working properly,
position the occupants in the rear
seating positions.

This vehicle is equipped with the INFINITI
Advanced Air Bag System for the driver and
front passenger seats. This system is de-
signed to meet certification requirements
under U.S. regulations. It is also permitted in
Canada. All of the information, cautions and
warnings in this manual apply and must be
followed.
The driver supplemental front-impact air
bag is located in the center of the steering
wheel. The passenger supplemental front-
impact air bag is mounted in the instrument
panel above the glove box. The front air bags
are designed to inflate in higher severity
frontal collisions, although they may inflate
if the forces in another type of collision are
similar to those of a higher severity frontal
impact. They may not inflate in certain
frontal collisions. Vehicle damage (or lack
of it) is not always an indication of proper
front air bag operation.
The INFINITI Advanced Air Bag System
monitors information from the Air bag
Control Unit (ACU), seat belt buckle sensors
and the occupant classification sensors
(weight sensors). Inflator operation is based
on the severity of a collision and seat belt
usage for the driver. For the front passenger,
the occupant classification sensors are also
monitored. Based on information from the
sensors, only one front air bag may inflate in
a crash, depending on the crash severity and

whether the front occupants are belted or
unbelted. Additionally, the front passenger
air bag may be automatically turned OFF
under some conditions, depending on the
information provided by the occupant clas-
sification sensors. If the front passenger air
bag is OFF, the front passenger air bag
status light will be illuminated (if the seat is
unoccupied, the light will not be illuminated,
but the air bag will be off). (See “Front
passenger air bag and status light” (P.1-60)
for further details.) One front air bag inflat-
ing does not indicate improper performance
of the system.
If you have any questions about your air bag
it is recommended you visit an
system,
INFINITI retailer.
If you are considering
modification of your vehicle due to a dis-
ability, you may also contact INFINITI.
Contact information is contained in the front
of this Owner’s Manual.
When a front air bag inflates, a fairly loud
noise may be heard, followed by release of
smoke. This smoke is not harmful and does
not indicate a fire. Care should be taken not
to inhale it, as it may cause irritation and
choking. Those with a history of a breathing
condition should get fresh air promptly.
Front air bags, along with the use of seat
belts, help to cushion the impact force on the
head and chest of the front occupants. They
can help save lives and reduce serious

injuries. However, an inflating front air bag
may cause facial abrasions or other injuries.
Front air bags do not provide restraint to the
lower body.
Even with INFINITI advanced air bags, seat
belts should be correctly worn and the driver
and passenger seated upright as far as
practical away from the steering wheel or
instrument panel. The front air bags inflate
quickly in order to help protect the front
occupants. Because of this, the force of the
front air bag inflating can increase the risk of
injury if the occupant is too close to, or is
against, the air bag module during inflation.
The front air bags deflate quickly after a
collision.
The front air bags operate only when the
ignition switch is in the ON position.
After pushing the ignition switch to the ON
position, the supplemental air bag warning
light illuminates. The supplemental air bag

Status light:
The front passenger seat is equipped with
the occupant classification sensors (weight
sensors) that turn the front passenger air
bag on or off depending on the weight
applied to the front passenger seat. The
status of the front passenger air bag (ON or

For additional
normal operation and troubleshooting of
this occupant classification sensor system,
please refer to “Normal operation” (P.1-62)
and “Troubleshooting” (P.1-62) in this sec-
tion.

Front passenger air bag:
The front passenger air bag is designed to
automatically turn OFF when the vehicle is
operated under some conditions as de-
scribed below as permitted by U.S. regula-
tions. If the front passenger air bag is OFF, it
will not inflate in a crash. The driver air bag
and other air bags in your vehicle are not
part of this system.
The purpose of the regulation is to help
reduce the risk of injury or death from an
inflating air bag to certain front passenger
seat occupants, such as children, by requiring
the air bag to be automatically turned OFF.
The occupant classification sensors (weight
sensors) are on the seat cushion frame under
the front passenger seat and are designed to
detect an occupant and objects on the seat.
For example,
if a child is in the front

passenger seat, the Advanced Air Bag
System is designed to turn the passenger
air bag OFF in accordance with the regula-
tions. Also, if a child restraint of the type
specified in the regulations is on the seat, the
occupant classification sensors can detect it
and cause the air bag to turn OFF.
Front passenger seat adult occupants who
are properly seated and using the seat belt
as outlined in this manual should not cause
the passenger air bag to be automatically
turned OFF. For small adults it may be
turned OFF, however, if the occupant does
not sit in the seat properly (for example, by
not sitting upright, by sitting on an edge of
the seat, or by otherwise being out of
position), this could cause the sensor to turn
the air bag OFF. Always be sure to be seated
and wearing the seat belt properly for the
most effective protection by the seat belt
and supplemental air bag.
INFINITI recommends that pre-teens and
children be properly restrained in a rear seat.
INFINITI also recommends that appropriate
child restraints and booster seats be prop-
erly installed in a rear seat. If this is not
possible, the occupant classification sensors
are designed to operate as described above
to turn the front passenger air bag OFF for
specified child restraints. Failing to properly
secure child restrains and to use the ALR
mode may allow the restraint to tip or move

in an accident or sudden stop. This can also
result in the passenger air bag inflating in a
crash instead of being OFF.
(See “Child
restraints” (P.1-31) for proper use and
installation.)
If the front passenger seat is not occupied,
the passenger air bag is designed not to
inflate in a crash. However, heavy objects
placed on the seat could result in air bag
inflation, because of the object being de-
tected by the occupant classification sen-
sors. Other conditions could also result in air
bag inflation, such as if a child is standing on
the seat, or if two children are on the seat,
contrary to the instructions in this manual.
Always be sure that you and all vehicle
occupants are seated and restrained prop-
erly.
Using the front passenger air bag status
light, you can monitor when the front
passenger air bag is automatically turned
OFF with the seat occupied. The light will
not illuminate when the front passenger seat
is unoccupied.
If an adult occupant is in the seat but the
front passenger air bag status light is
illuminated (indicating that the air bag is
OFF), it could be that the person is a small
adult, or is not sitting on the seat properly.
If a child restraint must be used in the front
seat, the front passenger air bag status light

Safety — seats, seat belts and supplemental restraint system 1-61

may or may not be illuminated, depending on
the size of the child and the type of child
restraint being used. If the front passenger
air bag status light is not illuminated (in-
dicating that the air bag might inflate in a
crash), it could be that the child restraint or
seat belt is not being used properly. Make
sure that the child restraint is installed
properly, the seat belt is used properly and
the occupant is positioned properly. If the
front passenger air bag status light is still not
illuminated, reposition the occupant or child
restraint in a rear seat.
If the front passenger air bag status light will
not illuminate even though you believe that
the child restraint, the seat belts and the
occupant are properly positioned, the sys-
tem may be sensing an unoccupied seat (in
which case the air bag is OFF). Your
INFINITI retailer can check that the system
is OFF by using a special tool. However, until
you have confirmed with your retailer that
your air bag is working properly, reposition
the occupant or child restraint in a rear seat.
The INFINITI Advanced Air Bag System and
front passenger air bag status light will take
a few seconds to register a change in the
passenger seat status. However, if the seat
becomes unoccupied, the front passenger air
bag status light will remain off.
If a malfunction occurs in the front passen-
ger air bag system, the supplemental air bag

, located in the meter and
warning light
gauges area will blink. Have the system
checked.
It is recommended you visit an
INFINITI retailer for this service.

Normal operation:
In order for the occupant classification
sensor system to classify the front passen-
ger based on weight, please follow the
precautions and steps outlined below:

Precautions:
. Make sure that there are no objects
weighing over 9.1 lbs (4 kg) hanging on
the seat or placed in the seatback pocket.
. Make sure that a child restraint or other
object is not pressing against the rear of
the seatback.

. Make sure that a rear passenger is not
pushing or pulling on the back of the
front passenger seat.

. Make sure that the front passenger seat
or seatback is not forced back against an
object on the seat or floor behind it.

. Make sure that there is no object placed

under the front passenger seat.

Steps:
1. Adjust the seat as outlined. (See “Seats”
(P.1-3).) Sit upright, leaning against the
seatback, and centered on the seat
cushion with your feet comfortably ex-
tended to the floor.

1-62 Safety — seats, seat belts and supplemental restraint system

2. Make sure there are no objects on your

lap.

3. Fasten the seat belt as outlined. (See

“Seat belts” (P.1-18).)

4. Remain in this position for 30 seconds
allowing the system to classify the front
passenger before the vehicle is put into
motion.

5. Ensure proper classification by checking
the front passenger air bag status light.

NOTE:
This vehicle’s occupant classification sensor
system locks the classification during driv-
ing so it is important that you confirm that
the front passenger is properly classified
prior to driving. Also, the occupant classifi-
cation sensor system may recalculate the
weight of the occupant when the vehicle
comes to a stop (i.e. stop light, stop sign,
etc.), so the front passenger seat occupant
should continue to remain seated as out-
lined above.
Troubleshooting:
If you think the front passenger air bag
status light is incorrect:
1.

If the light is ON with no front
passenger and no objects on the front
passenger seat:

This may be due to the following conditions
that may be interfering with the weight

sensors:
. An object weighing over 9.1 lbs (4 kg)
hanging on the seat or placed in the
seatback pocket.

. A child restraint or other object pressing

against the rear of the seatback.

. A rear passenger pushing or pulling on

the back of the front passenger seat.

. Forcing the front seat or seatback
against an object on the seat or floor
behind it.

. An object placed under the front passen-

ger seat.

. An object placed between the seat
cushion and center console or between
the seat cushion and the door.

If the vehicle is moving, please come to a
stop when it is safe to do so. Check and
correct any of the above conditions. Restart
the vehicle and wait 1 minute.

NOTE:
A system check will be performed during
which the front passenger air bag status
light will remain lit for about 7 seconds
initially.
If the light is still ON after this,
it is
recommended that the vehicle be checked
by an INFINITI retailer as soon as possible.
If the light is ON with an adult occupy-
2.
ing the front passenger seat:

. Occupant is a small adult — the front
passenger air bag status light is func-
tioning as intended. The front passenger
air bag is suppressed.

However, if the occupant is not a small adult,
then this may be due to the following
conditions that may be interfering with the
weight sensors:
. Occupant is not sitting upright, leaning
against the seatback, and centered on
the seat cushion with his/her feet com-
fortably extended to the floor.

. A child restraint or other object pressing

against the rear of the seatback.

. A rear passenger pushing or pulling on

the back of the front passenger seat.

. Forcing the front seat or seatback
against an object on the seat or floor
behind it.

. An object placed under the front passen-

ger seat.

. An object placed between the seat
cushion and center console or between
the seat cushion and the door.

If the vehicle is moving, please come to a
stop when it is safe to do so. Check and
correct any of the above conditions. Restart
the vehicle and wait 1 minute.

NOTE:
A system check will be performed during
which the front passenger air bag status
light will remain lit for about 7 seconds
initially.
If the light is still ON after this, the person
should be advised not to ride in the front
passenger seat and it is recommended that
the vehicle be checked by an INFINITI
retailer as soon as possible.
3.

If the light is OFF with a small adult,
child or child restraint occupying the
front passenger seat.
This may be due to the following
conditions that may be interfering with
the weight sensors:

. Small adult or child is not sitting upright,
leaning against the seatback, and cen-
tered on the seat cushion with his/her
feet comfortably extended to the floor.
. The child restraint is not properly in-
(See “Child re-

stalled, as outlined.
straints” (P.1-31).)

. An object weighing over 9.1 lbs (4 kg)
hanging on the seat or placed in the
seatback pocket.

. A child restraint or other object pressing

against the rear of the seatback.

. A rear passenger pushing or pulling on

the back of the front passenger seat.

Safety — seats, seat belts and supplemental restraint system 1-63

. Forcing the front seat or seatback
against an object on the seat or floor
behind it.

. An object placed under the front passen-

ger seat.

. An object placed between the seat

cushion and center console.

If the vehicle is moving, please come to a
stop when it is safe to do so. Check and
correct any of the above conditions. Restart
the vehicle and wait 1 minute.

NOTE:
A system check will be performed during
which the front passenger air bag status

Other supplemental front-impact
air bag precautions

WARNING

. Do not place any objects on the
steering wheel pad or on the instru-
ment panel. Also, do not place any
objects between any occupant and
the steering wheel or instrument
panel. Such objects may become
dangerous projectiles and cause in-
jury if the front air bags inflate.

. Do not place objects with sharp edges
on the seat. Also, do not place heavy
objects on the seat that will
leave
permanent impressions in the seat.
Such objects can damage the seat or
occupant classification sensors
(weight sensors). This can affect the
operation of the air bag system and
result in serious personal injury.

. Do not use water or acidic cleaners
(hot steam cleaners) on the seat. This
can damage the seat or occupant
classification sensors. This can also
affect the operation of the air bag
system and result in serious personal
injury.

.

Immediately after inflation, several
front air bag system components will
be hot. Do not touch them; you may
severely burn yourself.

. No unauthorized changes should be
made to any components or wiring of
the supplemental air bag system. This
is to prevent accidental inflation of
the supplemental air bag or damage
to the supplemental air bag system.
. Do not make unauthorized changes
to your vehicle’s electrical system,
suspension system or front end struc-
ture. This could affect proper opera-
tion of the front air bag system.

. Tampering with the air bag system
may result in serious personal injury.
Tampering includes changes to the
steering wheel and the instrument
panel assembly by placing material
over the steering wheel pad and
above the instrument panel or by
installing additional trim material
around the air bag system.

. Removing or modifying the front
passenger seat may affect the func-
tion of the air bag system and result
in serious personal injury.

. Modifying or tampering with the
front passenger seat may result in
serious personal injury. For example,

1-64 Safety — seats, seat belts and supplemental restraint system

. A cracked windshield should be re-
placed immediately by a qualified
repair facility. A cracked windshield
could affect the function of the
supplemental air bag system.

yellow and orange for easy identifica-
tion.

When selling your vehicle, we request that
you inform the buyer about the front air bag
system and guide the buyer to the appro-
priate sections in this Owner’s Manual.

do not change the front seats by
placing material on the seat cushion
or by installing additional trim mate-
rial, such as seat covers, on the seat
that is not specifically designed to
assure proper air bag operation.
Additionally, do not stow any objects
under the front passenger seat or the
seat cushion and seatback. Such
objects may interfere with the proper
operation of the occupant classifica-
tion sensors.

.

. No unauthorized changes should be
made to any components or wiring of
the seat belt system. This may affect
the front air bag system. Tampering
with the seat belt system may result
in serious personal injury.
It is recommended you visit an
INFINITI retailer for work on and
around the front air bag. It is also
recommended you visit an INFINITI
retailer for installation of electrical
equipment. The Supplemental Re-
straint System (SRS) wiring har-
nesses* should not be modified or
disconnected. Unauthorized electrical
test equipment and probing devices
should not be used on the air bag
system.

SSS1092

FRONT SEAT-MOUNTED SIDE-
IMPACT SUPPLEMENTAL AIR
BAG AND ROOF-MOUNTED
CURTAIN SIDE-IMPACT AND
ROLLOVER SUPPLEMENTAL AIR
BAG SYSTEMS
The side air bags are located in the outside
of the seatback of the front seats. The
curtain air bags are located in the side roof
rails. All of the information, cautions and
warnings in this manual apply and must be
followed. The side air bags and curtain air
bags are designed to inflate in higher
severity side collisions, although they may

Safety — seats, seat belts and supplemental restraint system 1-65

inflate if the forces in another type of
collision are similar to those of a higher
severity side impact. They are designed to
inflate on the side where the vehicle is
impacted. They may not inflate in certain
side collisions on the side where the vehicle is
impacted.
Curtain air bags are also designed to inflate
in certain types of rollover collisions or near
rollovers. As a result, certain vehicle move-
ments (for example, during severe off road-
ing) may cause the curtain air bags to inflate.
Vehicle damage (or lack of it) is not always
an indication of proper side air bag and
curtain air bag operation.
When side air bags and curtain air bags
inflate, a fairly loud noise may be heard,
followed by release of smoke. This smoke is
not harmful and does not indicate a fire.
Care should be taken not to inhale it, as it
may cause irritation and choking. Those with
a history of a breathing condition should get
fresh air promptly.
Side air bags, along with the use of seat
belts, help to cushion the impact force on the
chest and pelvis of the front occupants.
Curtain air bags help to cushion the impact
force to the head of occupants in the front
and rear (2nd and 3rd) outboard seating
positions. They can help save lives and
reduce serious injuries. However, an inflating

side air bag or curtain air bag may cause
abrasions or other injuries. Side air bags and
curtain air bags do not provide restraint to
the lower body.
The seat belts should be correctly worn and
the driver and passenger seated upright as
far as practical away from the side air bag.
Rear seat passengers should be seated as far
away as practical from the door finishers
and side roof rails. The side air bags and
curtain air bags inflate quickly in order to
help protect the occupants. Because of this,
the force of the side air bags and curtain air
bags inflating can increase the risk of injury if
the occupant is too close to, or is against,
these air bag modules during inflation. In a
rollover, the curtain air bags on both sides
are designed to inflate. Under both side-
impact situations, the curtain air bags will
remain inflated for a short period of time.
The side air bags and curtain air bags
operate only when the ignition switch is in
the ON position.
After pushing the ignition switch to the ON
position, the supplemental air bag warning
light illuminates. The air bag warning light
will turn off after about 7 seconds if the
systems are operational.

1-66 Safety — seats, seat belts and supplemental restraint system

WARNING

. Do not place any objects near the
seatback of the front seats. Also, do
not place any objects (an umbrella,
bag, etc.) between the front door
finisher and the front seat. Such
objects may become dangerous pro-
jectiles and cause injury if side air bag
inflates.

. Right after inflation, several side air
bags and curtain air bag system
components will be hot. Do not touch
them; you may severely burn your-
self.

. No unauthorized changes should be
made to any components or wiring of
side air bag and curtain air bags. This
is to prevent damage to or accidental
inflation of the side air bag and
curtain air bag systems.

. Do not make unauthorized changes
to your vehicle’s electrical system,
suspension system or side panel. This
could affect proper operation of the
side air bag and curtain air bag
systems.

. Tampering with the air bag system
may result in serious personal injury.
For example, do not change the front

seats by placing material near the
seatback or by installing additional
trim material, such as seat covers,
around the side air bags.

.

. Removing or modifying the front
passenger seat may affect the func-
tion of the air bag system and result
in serious personal injury.
It is recommended you visit an
INFINITI retailer for work on and
around the side air bag and curtain
air bag. It is also recommended you
visit an INFINITI retailer for installa-
tion of electrical equipment. The
Supplemental Restraint System
(SRS) wiring harnesses* should not
be modified or disconnected. Un-
authorized electrical test equipment
and probing devices should not be
used on the side-impact air bag
system.

*

The SRS wiring harness connectors are
yellow and orange for easy identifica-
tion.

When selling your vehicle, we request that
you inform the buyer about the side air bag
and curtain air bag systems and guide the
buyer to the appropriate sections in this
Owner’s Manual.

SEAT BELTS WITH PRETEN-
SIONERS (front seats)

WARNING

.

. The pretensioners cannot be reused
after activation. They must be re-
placed together with the retractor
and buckle as a unit.
If the vehicle becomes involved in a
collision but a pretensioner is not
activated, be sure to have the pre-
tensioner system checked and,
if
necessary, replaced.
It is recom-
mended you visit an INFINITI retailer
for this service.

. No unauthorized changes should be
made to any components or wiring of
the pretensioner system. This is to
prevent damage to or accidental
activation of the pretensioners. Tam-
pering with the pretensioner system
may result in serious personal injury.
It is recommended you visit an
INFINITI retailer for work on and
around the pretensioner system. It is
also recommended you visit an
INFINITI retailer for installation of
electrical equipment. Unauthorized
electrical test equipment and probing

.

.

devices should not be used on the
pretensioner system.
If you need to dispose of a preten-
sioner or scrap the vehicle,
it is
recommended you visit an INFINITI
retailer for this service. Correct pre-
tensioner disposal procedures are set
forth in the appropriate INFINITI
Service Manual.
Incorrect disposal
procedures could cause personal in-
jury.

The pretensioner system may activate with
the supplemental air bag system in certain
types of collisions. Working with the seat
belt retractor, it helps tighten the seat belt
when the vehicle becomes involved in certain
types of collisions, helping to restrain front
seat occupants.
The pretensioner is encased with the seat
belt retractor and buckle anchor. These seat
belts are used the same way as conventional
seat belts.
When a pretensioner activates, smoke is
released and a loud noise may be heard. The
smoke is not harmful, and it does not
indicate a fire. Care should be taken not to
inhale it as it may cause irritation and
choking. Those with a history of a breathing
condition should get fresh air promptly.

Safety — seats, seat belts and supplemental restraint system 1-67

serious injury or death.

After pretensioner activation, load limiters
allow the seat belt to release webbing (if
necessary) to reduce forces against the
chest.
The supplemental air bag warning light
is used to indicate malfunctions in the
pretensioner system.
(See “Supplemental
air bag warning light” (P.1-69) for more
details.) If the operation of the supplemental
air bag warning light indicates there is a
malfunction, have the system checked. It is
recommended you visit an INFINITI retailer
for this service.
When selling your vehicle, we request that
you inform the buyer about the pretensioner
system and guide the buyer to the appro-
priate sections in this Owner’s Manual.

SECURITY SYSTEMS

SIC2133

Your vehicle has two types of security
systems, as follows:
. Vehicle security system
.
The security condition will be shown by the
security indicator light.

INFINITI Vehicle Immobilizer System

VEHICLE SECURITY SYSTEM
The vehicle security system provides visual
and audio alarm signals if someone opens
the doors, hood, or liftgate when the system
is armed.
It is not, however, a motion
detection type system that activates when
a vehicle is moved or when a vibration
occurs.
The system helps deter vehicle theft but
cannot prevent it, nor can it prevent the
theft of interior or exterior vehicle compo-
nents in all situations. Always secure your
vehicle even if parking for a brief period.
Never leave your Intelligent Key(s) in the
vehicle, and always lock it when unattended.
Be aware of your surroundings, and park in
secure, well-lit areas whenever possible.
Many devices offering additional protection,
such as component locks,
identification
markers, and tracking systems, are available
at auto supply stores and specialty shops.
Your INFINITI retailer may also offer such
equipment. Check with your insurance com-
pany to see if you may be eligible for
discounts for various theft protection fea-
tures.

SIC2045

How to arm the vehicle security
system
1. Close all windows.

The system can be armed even if the
windows are open.

2. Push the ignition switch to the OFF

3. Remove the Intelligent Key from the

position.

4. Close all doors, hood and liftgate. Lock
all doors. The doors can be locked with
the Intelligent Key, door handle request
switch, power door lock switch or me-
chanical key.

Instruments and controls 2-31

5. Confirm that the security indicator light
comes on. The security indicator light
stays on for about 30 seconds. The
vehicle security system is now pre-
armed. After about 30 seconds the
vehicle security system automatically
shifts into the armed phase. The security
light begins to flash once every approxi-
mately 3 seconds.
If, during this 30-
second pre-arm time period, the door is
unlocked, or the ignition switch is pushed
to ACC or ON, the system will not arm.
Even when the driver and/or passengers
are in the vehicle, the system will activate
with all doors, hood, and liftgate locked
with the ignition switch in the LOCK
position. When pushing the ignition switch
to the ACC or ON position, the system will
be released.

Vehicle security system activation
The vehicle security system will give the
following alarm:
. The headlights blink and the horn sounds

intermittently.

. The alarm automatically turns off after
approximately 50 seconds. However, the
alarm reactivates if the vehicle is tam-
pered with again.

The alarm is activated by:
. Unlocking the door or opening the lift-
gate without using the button on the
Intelligent Key, the door handle request
switch or the mechanical key. (Even if the
door is opened by releasing the door
inside lock knob, the alarm will activate.)

. Opening the hood.

How to stop an activated alarm
The alarm will stop when a door is unlocked
by pushing the unlock button on the Intelli-
gent Key, the door handle request switch or
using the mechanical key, or when the
ignition switch is pushed to the ACC or ON
position.
If the system does not operate as described
above,
it is recommended you have it
checked by an INFINITI retailer.

INFINITI VEHICLE IMMOBILIZER

RAIN-SENSING AUTO WIPER
SYSTEM
The rain-sensing auto wiper system can
automatically turn on the wipers and adjust
the wiper speed depending on the rainfall
and the vehicle speed by using the rain
sensor located on the upper part of the
windshield.
To set the rain-sensing auto wiper system,
push the lever down to the AUTO position
. The wiper will sweep once while the

ignition switch is in the ON position.
The rain sensor sensitivity level can be
adjusted by turning the knob toward the
front

(High) or toward the rear

(Low).

. Be sure to turn off the rain-sensing auto
wiper system when you use a car wash.
. When the ignition switch is in the ON
position and the vehicle speed is below
approximately 5 MPH (8 km/h) with
the shift lever in the N (Neutral) posi-
tion, the rain-sensing auto wipers will
not operate.

. Using genuine wiper blades is recom-
mended for proper operation of the
rain-sensing auto wiper system. (See

HomeLink® UNIVERSAL
TRANSCEIVER (Type A) (if so equipped)

The HomeLink® Universal Transceiver pro-
vides a convenient way to consolidate the
functions of up to three individual hand-held
transmitters into one built-in device.
HomeLink® Universal Transceiver:
. Will operate most Radio Frequency (RF)
devices such as garage doors, gates,
home and office lighting, entry door
locks and security systems.
Is powered by your vehicle’s battery. No
separate batteries are required. If the
vehicle’s battery is discharged or is
disconnected, HomeLink® will retain all
programming.

.

When the HomeLink® Universal Transceiver
is programmed, retain the original trans-
mitter for future programming procedures
(Example: new vehicle purchases). Upon
sale of the vehicle, the programmed
HomeLink® Universal Transceiver buttons
should be erased for security purposes. For
additional information, refer to “Program-
ming HomeLink®” (P.2-69).

WARNING

. Do not use the HomeLink® Universal
Transceiver with any garage door
opener that lacks safety stop and
reverse features as required by fed-
eral safety standards. (These stan-

dards became effective for opener
models manufactured after April 1,
1982.) A garage door opener which
cannot detect an object in the path of
a closing garage door and then auto-
matically stop and reverse, does not
meet current federal safety stan-
dards. Using a garage door opener
without these features increases the
risk of serious injury or death.

. During the programming procedure
your garage door or security gate will
open and close (if the transmitter is
within range). Make sure that people
or objects are clear of the garage
door, gate, etc. that you are pro-
gramming.

. Your vehicle’s engine should be
turned off while programming the
HomeLink® Universal Transceiver.
Do not breathe exhaust gases; they
contain colorless and odorless carbon
monoxide. Carbon monoxide is dan-
gerous. It can cause unconsciousness
or death.

PROGRAMMING HomeLink®

accurate transmission of the radio-fre-
quency.
1. Position the end of your hand-held
transmitter 1-3 in (26-76 mm) away
from the HomeLink® surface, keeping
the HomeLink® indicator light
in view.

locating the button, reference the garage
door opener’s manual.

5. Press and release the “learn” or “smart”

button.

NOTE:
Once the button is pressed, you have
approximately 30 seconds to initiate the
next step.

PROGRAMMING HomeLink® FOR
CANADIAN CUSTOMERS AND
GATE OPENERS
Canadian radio-frequency laws require
transmitter signals to “time-out” (or quit)
after several seconds of transmission –
which may not be long enough for
HomeLink® to pick up the signal during
programming. Similar to this Canadian law,
some U.S. gate operators are designed to
“time-out” in the same manner.
If you live in Canada or you are having
difficulties programming a gate operator or
garage door opener by using the “Program-
ming HomeLink®” procedures, replace “Pro-
gramming HomeLink®” Step 2 with the
following:

NOTE:
When programming a garage door opener,
etc., unplug the device during the “cycling”
process to prevent possible damage to the
garage door opener components.
Step 2: Using both hands, simultaneously
press and hold the desired HomeLink®
button and the hand-held transmitter but-
ton. During programming, your hand-held
transmitter may automatically stop trans-
mitting. Continue to press and hold the
desired HomeLink® button while you press
and re-press (“cycle”) your hand-held trans-

mitter every two seconds until the frequency
signal has been learned. The HomeLink®
indicator light will flash slowly and then
rapidly after several seconds upon success-
ful programming. DO NOT release until the
HomeLink® indicator light flashes slowly and
then rapidly. When the indicator light flashes
rapidly, both buttons may be released. The
rapid flashing indicates successful program-
ming.
Proceed with “Programming HomeLink®”
step 3 to complete.
Remember to plug the device back in when
programming is completed.
OPERATING THE HomeLink®
UNIVERSAL TRANSCEIVER
The HomeLink® Universal Transceiver, after
it is programmed, can be used to activate the
programmed device. To operate, simply
press and release the appropriate pro-
grammed HomeLink® Universal Transceiver
button. The amber indicator light will illumi-
nate while the signal is being transmitted.
For convenience, the hand-held transmitter
of the device may also be used at any time.

PROGRAMMING TROUBLE-
SHOOTING
If the HomeLink® does not quickly learn the
hand-held transmitter information:
.

replace the hand-held transmitter bat-
teries with new batteries.

. position the hand-held transmitter with
its battery area facing away from the
HomeLink® surface.

. press and hold both the HomeLink® and
hand-held transmitter buttons without

PROGRAMMING HomeLink® FOR
CANADIAN CUSTOMERS AND
GATE OPENERS
Canadian radio-frequency laws require
transmitter signals to “time-out” (or quit)
after several seconds of transmission –
which may not be long enough for
HomeLink® to pick up the signal during
programming. Similar to this Canadian law,
some U.S. gate operators are designed to
“time-out” in the same manner.
If you live in Canada or you are having
difficulties programming a gate operator or
garage door opener by using the “Program-
ming HomeLink®” procedures, replace “Pro-
gramming HomeLink®” Step 3 with the
following:

NOTE:
When programming a garage door opener,
etc., unplug the device during the “cycling”
process to prevent possible damage to the
device components.
Step 3: While the HomeLink® indicator light
is flashing in orange, press and release
(“cycling”) the hand-held transmitter button
every 2 seconds. Continue to press and
release the hand-held transmitter button
until the HomeLink® indicator light changes
from orange to green. When the indicator
light illuminates in green, hand-held trans-

mitter button may be released.
Proceed with “Programming HomeLink®”
step 4 to complete.
Remember to plug the device back in when
programming is completed.
OPERATING THE HomeLink®
UNIVERSAL TRANSCEIVER
The HomeLink® Universal Transceiver, after
it is programmed, can be used to activate the
programmed device. To operate, firmly press
the appropriate programmed HomeLink®
button. The indicator light will illuminate in
on the
green with three parenthesis
mirror while the signal is being transmitted.

PROGRAMMING TROUBLE-
SHOOTING
If the HomeLink® does not quickly learn the
hand-held transmitter information:
.

its battery area facing away from the
HomeLink® button.

. press and hold the HomeLink® button
and hand-held transmitter button in
each step without interruption.

. position the hand-held transmitter 1 to 3
in (2 to 8 cm) away from the HomeLink®

button. Hold the transmitter in that
position for up to 15 seconds.
If
HomeLink® is not programmed within
that time, try holding the transmitter in
another position - for example, 6 to 12 in
(15 to 30 cm) away, keeping the
HomeLink® button in view at all times.

If you have any questions or are having
difficulty programming your HomeLink®
buttons, refer to the HomeLink® web site

USING THE GARAGE DOOR
TWO-WAY COMMUNICATION
HomeLink® has the function of communi-
cating with garage door opener systems. If
your garage door openers are compatible
with HomeLink®, the HomeLink® can:
.

receive and display “closing” or “opening”
status from your garage door opener.
recall and display the garage door being
“closed” or “opened”.

.

HomeLink® can receive the status from a
garage door opener at a range up to 820 ft
(250 m), but it varies depending on the
environment. You may need to reduce
vehicle speed to successfully receive the
garage door opener communication.

KEYS

A key number plate is supplied with your
keys. Record the key number and keep it in a
safe place (such as your wallet), not in the
vehicle. If you lose your keys, it is recom-
mended you visit an INFINITI retailer for
duplicates by using the key number. INFINITI
does not record any key numbers so it is very
important to keep track of your key number
plate.
A key number is only necessary when you
have lost all keys and do not have one to
duplicate from. If you still have a key, it can
be duplicated without knowing the key
number.

FUEL-FILLER CAP

WARNING

. Gasoline is extremely flammable and
highly explosive under certain condi-
tions. You could be burned or ser-
iously injured if it is misused or
mishandled. Always stop engine and
do not smoke or allow open flames or
sparks near the vehicle when refuel-
ing.

. Do not attempt to top off the fuel
tank after the fuel pump nozzle shuts
off automatically. Continued refuel-
ing may cause fuel overflow, resulting
in fuel spray and possibly a fire.

. Use only an original equipment type
fuel-filler cap as a replacement. It has
a built-in safety valve needed for
proper operation of the fuel system
and emission control system. An in-
correct cap can result in a serious

malfunction and possible injury.
It
could also cause the malfunction
indicator light to come on.

. Never pour fuel into the throttle body

to attempt to start your vehicle.

. Do not fill a portable fuel container in
the vehicle or trailer. Static electricity
can cause an explosion of flammable
liquid, vapor or gas in any vehicle or
trailer. To reduce the risk of serious
injury or death when filling portable
fuel containers:
— Always place the container on the

ground when filling.

— Do not use electronic devices

when filling.

— Keep the pump nozzle in contact
with the container while you are
filling it.

— Use only approved portable fuel
containers for flammable liquid.

CAUTION

The automatic drive positioner system has
three features:
. Entry/exit function
. Memory storage
. Setting memory function

ENTRY/EXIT FUNCTION
This system is designed so that the driver’s
seat and steering column will automatically
move when the automatic transmission shift
lever is in the P (Park) position. This allows
the driver to get into and out of the driver’s
seat more easily.
The driver’s seat will slide backward and the
steering wheel will move up when the
driver’s door is opened with the ignition
switch in the LOCK position.
The driver’s seat and steering wheel will
return to the previous positions when the
ignition switch is pushed to the ACC posi-
tion.
The driver’s seat will not return to the
previous positions if the seat or steering
adjusting switch is operated when the seat is
at the exit position.

Cancel or activate entry/exit func-
tion
The shift lever must be in the P (Park)
position with the ignition switch in the OFF
position.
The entry/exit function can be activated or
canceled by pressing and holding the SET
switch for more than 10 seconds.

fuse opens, the entry/exit function will not
work though this function was set on before.
In such a case, after connecting the battery
or replacing with a new fuse, open and close
the driver’s door more than two times after
the ignition switch is turned from the ON
position to the LOCK position. The entry/
exit function will be activated.

Two positions for the driver’s seat, steering
column and outside mirrors can be stored in
the automatic drive positioner memory.
Follow these procedures to use the memory
system.
1. Move the shift lever to the P (Park)

position.

2. Adjust the driver’s seat, steering column
and outside mirrors to the desired posi-
tions by manually operating each adjust-
ing switch. For additional
information,

WARNING

. The distance guide lines and the
vehicle width lines should be used as
a reference only when the vehicle is
on a paved, level surface. The appar-
ent distance viewed on the monitor
may be different than the actual
distance between the vehicle and
displayed objects.

. Use the displayed lines and the bird’s-
eye view as a reference. The lines and
the bird’s-eye view are greatly af-
fected by the number of occupants,
fuel level, vehicle position, road con-
dition and road grade.
If the tires are replaced with different
sized tires, the predictive course lines
and the bird’s-eye view may be dis-
played incorrectly.

.

. When driving the vehicle up a hill,
objects viewed in the monitor are
further than they appear. When
driving the vehicle down a hill, objects
viewed in the monitor are closer than
they appear.

. Objects in the monitor will appear
visually opposite compared to when
viewed in the rear view and outside
mirrors.

. Use the mirrors or actually look to
properly judge distances to other
objects.

. The distance between objects viewed
in the rear view differs from actual
distance because a wide-angle lens is
used.

. On a snow-covered or slippery road,
there may be a difference between
the predictive course line and the
actual course line.

. The vehicle width and predictive
course lines are wider than the actual
width and course.

. The displayed lines on the rear view
will appear slightly off to the right

SONAR SYSTEM OPERATION
The system gives the tone for front objects
when the shift lever is in the D (Drive)
position and both front and rear objects
when the shift lever is in the R (Reverse)
position.
When the camera image is shown on the
center display, the system shows the sonar
indicator regardless of the shift lever posi-
tion.
The system is deactivated at speeds above 6
MPH (10 km/h). It is reactivated at lower
speeds.
The colors of the sonar indicators and the
distance guide lines in the front, front-wide,
rear and rear-wide views indicate different
distances to the object.
When the objects are detected, the indicator
(green) appears and blinks and the tone
sounds intermittently. When the vehicle
moves closer to the object, the color of the
indicator turns yellow and the rate of the
blinking and the rate of the tone increase.
When the vehicle is very close to the object,
the indicator stops blinking and turns red,
and the tone sounds continuously.
The intermittent tone will stop after 3
seconds when an object is detected by only
the sonar and the distance does not change.
The tone will stop when the object is no

PRECAUTIONS WHEN STARTING
AND DRIVING

WARNING

. Do not leave children or adults who
would normally require the support
of others alone in your vehicle. Pets
should not be left alone either. They
could accidentally injure themselves
or others through inadvertent opera-
tion of the vehicle. Also, on hot,
sunny days, temperatures in a closed
vehicle could quickly become high
enough to cause severe or possibly
fatal injuries to people or animals.

. Properly secure all cargo to help
prevent it from sliding or shifting.
Do not place cargo higher than the
seatbacks. In a sudden stop or colli-
sion, unsecured cargo could cause
personal injury.

EXHAUST GAS (carbon monoxide)

WARNING

. Do not breathe exhaust gases; they
contain colorless and odorless carbon
monoxide. Carbon monoxide is dan-
gerous. It can cause unconsciousness
or death.

5-4 Starting and driving

.

If you suspect that exhaust fumes are
entering the vehicle, drive with all
windows fully open, and have the
vehicle inspected immediately.

. Do not run the engine in closed spaces

such as a garage.

. Do not park the vehicle with the
engine running for any extended
length of time.

. Keep the liftgate closed while driving,
otherwise exhaust gases could be
drawn into the passenger compart-
ment.
If you must drive with the
liftgate open, follow these precau-
tions:
1) Open all the windows.
2) Set the

air recirculation to
off and the fan control to high to
circulate the air.

.

If electrical wiring or other cable
connections must pass to a trailer
through the seal on the liftgate or the
body, follow the manufacturer’s re-
commendation to prevent carbon
monoxide entry into the vehicle.

. The exhaust system and body should
be inspected by a qualified mechanic
whenever:
— The vehicle is raised for service.

— You suspect that exhaust fumes
are entering into the passenger
compartment.

— You notice a change in the sound

of the exhaust system.

— You have had an accident invol-
ving damage to the exhaust sys-
tem, underbody, or rear of the
vehicle.

THREE-WAY CATALYST
The three-way catalyst is an emission con-
trol device installed in the exhaust system.
Exhaust gases in the three-way catalyst are
burned at high temperatures to help reduce
pollutants.

WARNING

. The exhaust gas and the exhaust
system are very hot. Keep people,
animals or flammable materials away
from the exhaust system compo-
nents.

. Do not stop or park the vehicle over
flammable materials such as dry
grass, waste paper or rags. They
may ignite and cause a fire.

CAUTION

. Do not use leaded gasoline. Deposits
from leaded gasoline seriously reduce
the three-way catalyst’s ability to
help reduce exhaust pollutants.

. Keep your engine tuned up. Malfunc-
tions in the ignition, fuel injection, or
electrical systems can cause overrich
fuel flow into the three-way catalyst,
causing it to overheat. Do not keep
driving if the engine misfires, or if
noticeable loss of performance or
other unusual operating conditions
are detected. Have the vehicle in-
spected promptly. It is recommended
you visit an INFINITI retailer for this
service.

. Avoid driving with an extremely low
fuel level. Running out of fuel could
cause the engine to misfire, damaging
the three-way catalyst.

. Do not race the engine while warming

it up.

. Do not push or tow your vehicle to

start the engine.

TIRE PRESSURE MONITORING
SYSTEM (TPMS)
Each tire, including the spare (if provided),
should be checked monthly when cold and
inflated to the inflation pressure recom-
mended by the vehicle manufacturer on the
vehicle placard or tire inflation pressure
label. (If your vehicle has tires of a different
size than the size indicated on the vehicle
placard or tire inflation pressure label, you
should determine the proper tire inflation
pressure for those tires.)
As an added safety feature, your vehicle has
been equipped with a Tire Pressure Mon-
itoring System (TPMS) that illuminates a low
tire pressure telltale when one or more of
your tires is significantly under-inflated.
Accordingly, when the low tire pressure
telltale illuminates, you should stop and
check your tires as soon as possible, and
inflate them to the proper pressure. Driving
on a significantly under-inflated tire causes
the tire to overheat and can lead to tire
failure. Under-inflation also reduces fuel
efficiency and tire tread life, and may affect
the vehicle’s handling and stopping ability.
Please note that the TPMS is not a sub-
stitute for proper tire maintenance, and it is
the driver’s responsibility to maintain correct
tire pressure, even if under-inflation has not
reached the level to trigger illumination of

the TPMS low tire pressure telltale.
Your vehicle has also been equipped with a
TPMS malfunction indicator to indicate
when the system is not operating properly.
The TPMS malfunction indicator is com-
bined with the low tire pressure telltale.
When the system detects a malfunction, the
telltale will flash for approximately one
minute and then remain continuously illumi-
nated. This sequence will continue upon
subsequent vehicle start-ups as long as the
malfunction exists. When the malfunction
indicator is illuminated, the system may not
be able to detect or signal low tire pressure
as intended. TPMS malfunctions may occur
for a variety of reasons,
including the
installation of replacement or alternate tires
or wheels on the vehicle that prevent the
TPMS from functioning properly. Always
check the TPMS malfunction telltale after
replacing one or more tires or wheels on your
vehicle to ensure that the replacement or
alternate tires and wheels allow the TPMS
to continue to function properly.

Additional information
. Since the spare tire is not equipped with
the TPMS, the TPMS does not monitor
the tire pressure of the spare tire.

. The TPMS will activate only when the
vehicle is driven at speeds above 16
MPH (25 km/h). Also, this system may

Starting and driving 5-5

not detect a sudden drop in tire pressure
(for example, a flat tire while driving).

. The low tire pressure warning light does
not automatically turn off when the tire
pressure is adjusted. After the tire is
inflated to the recommended pressure,
the vehicle must be driven at speeds
above 16 MPH (25 km/h) to activate the
TPMS and turn off the low tire pressure
warning light. Use a tire pressure gauge
to check the tire pressure.

. The CHECK TIRE PRESSURE warning
appears in the vehicle information dis-
play when the low tire pressure warning
light is illuminated and low tire pressure
is detected. The CHECK TIRE PRES-
SURE warning turns off when the low
tire pressure warning light turns off.
The CHECK TIRE PRESSURE warning
appears each time the ignition switch is
placed in the ON position as long as the
low tire pressure warning light remains
illuminated.
The CHECK TIRE PRESSURE warning
does not appear if the low tire pressure
warning light illuminates to indicate a
TPMS malfunction.

. Tire pressure rises and falls depending on
the heat caused by the vehicle’s opera-
tion and the outside temperature. Do not
reduce the tire pressure after driving
because the tire pressure rises after

5-6 Starting and driving

driving. Low outside temperature can
lower the temperature of the air inside
the tire which can cause a lower tire
inflation pressure. This may cause the
low tire pressure warning light to illumi-
nate. If the warning light illuminates in
low ambient temperature, check the tire
pressure for all four tires.

. You can also check the pressure of all
tires (except the spare tire) on the center
display. (See INFINITI InTouchTM Own-
er’s Manual.) The order of the tire
pressure figures displayed on the screen
may not correspond with the actual
order of the tire position.

For additional
information, see “Low tire
pressure warning light” (P.2-15) and “Tire
Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) ” (P.6-
3).

WARNING

.

If the low tire pressure warning light
illuminates or Low Pressure informa-
tion is displayed on the monitor
screen while driving, avoid sudden
steering maneuvers or abrupt brak-
ing, reduce vehicle speed, pull off the
road to a safe location and stop the
vehicle as soon as possible. Driving
with under-inflated tires may perma-

nently damage the tires and increase
the likelihood of tire failure. Serious
vehicle damage could occur and may
lead to an accident and could result in
serious personal injury. Check the tire
pressure for all four tires. Adjust the
tire pressure to the recommended
COLD tire pressure shown on the
Tire and Loading Information label to
turn the low tire pressure warning
light OFF. If the light still illuminates
while driving after adjusting the tire
pressure, a tire may be flat or the
TPMS may be malfunctioning. If you
have a flat tire, replace it with a spare
tire as soon as possible. If no tire is
flat and all tires are properly inflated,
it is recommended you consult an
INFINITI retailer.

. Since the spare tire is not equipped
with the TPMS, when a spare tire is
mounted or a wheel is replaced, the
TPMS will not function and the low
tire pressure warning light will flash
for approximately 1 minute. The light
will remain on after 1 minute. Have
your tires replaced and/or TPMS
system reset as soon as possible. It
is recommended you visit an INFINITI
retailer for these services.

. Replacing tires with those not origin-
ally specified by INFINITI could affect

the proper operation of the TPMS.

. Do not inject any tire liquid or aerosol
tire sealant into the tires, as this may
cause a malfunction of the tire pres-
sure sensors.

CAUTION

. The TPMS may not function properly
when the wheels are equipped with
tire chains or the wheels are buried in
snow.

. Do not place metalized film or any
metal parts (antenna, etc.) on the
windows. This may cause poor recep-
tion of the signals from the tire
pressure sensors, and the TPMS will
not function properly.

Some devices and transmitters may tem-
porarily interfere with the operation of the
TPMS and cause the low tire pressure
warning light to illuminate. Some examples
are:
. Facilities or electric devices using similar

.

radio frequencies are near the vehicle.
If a transmitter set to similar frequencies
is being used in or near the vehicle.

.

If a computer (or similar equipment) or a
DC/AC converter is being used in or near
the vehicle.

.

.

Low tire pressure warning light may illumi-
nate in the following cases.
.

If the vehicle is equipped with a wheel
and tire without TPMS.
If the TPMS has been replaced and the ID
has not been registered.
If the wheel is not originally specified by
INFINITI.

TPMS with Tire Inflation Indicator
When adding air to an under-inflated tire,
the TPMS with Tire Inflation Indicator
provides visual and audible signals outside
the vehicle to help you inflate the tires to the
recommended COLD tire pressure.

Vehicle set-up:
1. Park the vehicle in a safe and level place.
2. Apply the parking brake and place the

shift lever in the P (Park) position.

3. Place the ignition switch in the ON

position. Do not start the engine.

Operation:
1. Add air to the tire.
2. After a few seconds, the hazard indica-

tors will start flashing.

3. When the designated pressure is
reached, the horn beeps once and the
hazard indicators stop flashing.

4. Perform the above steps for each tire.
.

If the tire is over-inflated more than
approximately 4 psi (30 kPa), the horn
beeps and the hazard indicators flash 3
times. To correct the pressure, push the
core of the valve stem on the tire briefly
to release pressure. When the pressure

Starting and driving 5-7

.

reaches the designated pressure, the
horn beeps once.
If the hazard indicator does not flash
within approximately 15 seconds after
starting to inflate the tire, it indicates
that the Tire Inflation Indicator is not
operating.

. The TPMS will not activate the Tire
Inflation Indicator under the following
conditions:
— If there is interference from an ex-

ternal device or transmitter

— The air pressure from the inflation
device such as those using a power
socket is not sufficient to inflate the
tire

— If an electrical equipment is being used

in or near the vehicle

— There is a malfunction in the TPMS

system

— There is a malfunction in the horn or

hazard indicators

.

If the Tire Inflation Indicator does not
operate due to TPMS interference, move
the vehicle about 3 ft (1m) backward or
forward and try again.

If the Tire Inflation Indicator is not working,
use a tire pressure gauge.

AVOIDING COLLISION AND
ROLLOVER

WARNING

Failure to operate this vehicle in a safe
and prudent manner may result in loss of
control or an accident.

Be alert and drive defensively at all times.
Obey all traffic regulations. Avoid excessive
speed, high speed cornering, or sudden
steering maneuvers, because these driving
practices could cause you to lose control of
your vehicle. As with any vehicle, a loss of
control could result in a collision with other
vehicles or objects, or cause the vehicle to
rollover, particularly if the loss of control
causes the vehicle to slide sideways. Be
attentive at all times, and avoid driving when
tired. Never drive when under the influence
of alcohol or drugs (including prescription or
over-the-counter drugs which may cause
drowsiness). Always wear your seat belt as
outlined in the “Seat belts” (P.1-18), and also
instruct your passengers to do so.
Seat belts help reduce the risk of injury in
collisions and rollovers. In a rollover crash,
an unbelted or improperly belted person is
significantly more likely to be injured or

killed than a person properly wearing a seat
belt.

ON-PAVEMENT AND OFF-ROAD
DRIVING PRECAUTIONS
Utility vehicles have a significantly higher
rollover rate than other types of vehicles.
They have higher ground clearance than
passenger cars to make them capable of
performing in a variety of on-pavement and
off-road applications. This gives them a
higher center of gravity than ordinary cars.
An advantage of higher ground clearance is
a better view of the road, allowing you to
anticipate problems. However, they are not
designed for cornering at the same speeds as
conventional passenger cars any more than
low-slung sports cars are designed to per-
form satisfactorily under off-road condi-
tions. If at all possible, avoid sharp turns or
abrupt maneuvers, particularly at high
speeds. As with other vehicles of this type,
failure to operate this vehicle correctly may
result in loss of control or vehicle rollover.
Seat belts help reduce the risk of injury in
collisions and rollovers. In a rollover crash, an
unbelted or improperly belted person is
significantly more likely to be injured or killed
than a person properly wearing a seat belt.
Be sure to read “Driving safety precautions”
(P.5-10).

OFF-ROAD RECOVERY
While driving, the right side or left side
wheels may unintentionally leave the road
surface. If this occurs, maintain control of
the vehicle by following the procedure
below. Please note that this procedure is
only a general guide. The vehicle must be
driven as appropriate based on the condi-
tions of the vehicle, road and traffic.
1. Remain calm and do not overreact.
2. Do not apply the brakes.
3. Maintain a firm grip on the steering
wheel with both hands and try to hold
a straight course.

5.

4. When appropriate, slowly release the
accelerator pedal to gradually slow the
vehicle.
If there is nothing in the way, steer the
vehicle to follow the road while the
vehicle speed is reduced. Do not attempt
to drive the vehicle back onto the road
surface until vehicle speed is reduced.

6. When it is safe to do so, gradually turn
the steering wheel until both tires return
to the road surface. When all tires are on
the road surface, steer the vehicle to stay
in the appropriate driving lane.
.

If you decide that it is not safe to
return the vehicle to the road surface
based on vehicle, road or traffic

conditions, gradually slow the vehicle
to a stop in a safe place off the road.

RAPID AIR PRESSURE LOSS
Rapid air pressure loss or a “blow-out” can
occur if the tire is punctured or is damaged
due to hitting a curb or pothole. Rapid air
pressure loss can also be caused by driving
on under-inflated tires.
Rapid air pressure loss can affect the
handling and stability of the vehicle, espe-
cially at highway speeds.
Help prevent rapid air pressure loss by
maintaining the correct air pressure and
visually inspect the tires for wear and
damage. See “Wheels and tires” (P.8-27).
If a tire rapidly loses air pressure or “blows-
out” while driving maintain control of the
vehicle by following the procedure below.
Please note that this procedure is only a
general guide. The vehicle must be driven as
appropriate based on the conditions of the
vehicle, road and traffic.

WARNING

The following actions can increase the
chance of losing control of the vehicle if
there is a sudden loss of tire air pressure.
Losing control of the vehicle may cause a

collision and result in personal injury.
. The vehicle generally moves or pulls

in the direction of the flat tire.

. Do not rapidly apply the brakes.
. Do not rapidly release the accelerator

. Do not rapidly turn the steering

pedal.

1. Remain calm and do not overreact.
2. Maintain a firm grip on the steering
wheel with both hands and try to hold
a straight course.

3. When appropriate, slowly release the
accelerator pedal to gradually slow the
vehicle.

4. Gradually steer the vehicle to a safe
location off the road and away from
traffic if possible.

5. Lightly apply the brake pedal to gradu-

ally stop the vehicle.

6. Turn on the hazard warning flashers and
either contact a roadside emergency
service to change the tire or see “Chan-
ging a flat tire” (P.6-4).

DRINKING ALCOHOL/DRUGS
AND DRIVING

WARNING

Never drive under the influence of alco-
hol or drugs. Alcohol in the bloodstream
reduces coordination, delays reaction
time and impairs judgement. Driving
after drinking alcohol increases the like-
lihood of being involved in an accident
injuring yourself and others. Addition-
ally, if you are injured in an accident,
alcohol can increase the severity of the
injury.

INFINITI is committed to safe driving. How-
ever, you must choose not to drive under the
influence of alcohol. Every year thousands of
people are injured or killed in alcohol-related
accidents. Although the local laws vary on
what is considered to be legally intoxicated,
the fact is that alcohol affects all people
differently and most people underestimate
the effects of alcohol.
Remember, drinking and driving don’t mix!
And that is true for drugs, too (over-the-
counter, prescription, and illegal drugs).
Don’t drive if your ability to operate your
vehicle is impaired by alcohol, drugs, or some

5-10 Starting and driving

other physical condition.

DRIVING SAFETY PRECAUTIONS
Your INFINITI is designed for both normal
and off-road use. However, avoid driving in
deep water or mud as your INFINITI
is
mainly designed for leisure use, unlike a
conventional off-road vehicle.
Remember that Two-Wheel Drive (2WD)
models are less capable than Four-Wheel
Drive (4WD) models for rough road driving
and extrication when stuck in deep snow,
mud, or the like.
Please observe the following precautions:

WARNING

. Drive carefully when off the road and
avoid dangerous areas. Every person
who drives or rides in this vehicle
should be seated with their seat belt
fastened. This will keep you and your
passengers in position when driving
over rough terrain.

. Do not drive across steep slopes.
Instead drive either straight up or
straight down the slopes. Off-road
vehicles can tip over sideways much
more easily than they can forward or
backward.

. Many hills are too steep for any
vehicle. If you drive up them, you
may stall. If you drive down them,
you may not be able to control your
speed. If you drive across them, you
may roll over.

. Do not shift ranges while driving on
downhill grades as this could cause
loss of control of the vehicle.

.

. Stay alert when driving to the top of
a hill. At the top there could be a
drop-off or other hazard that could
cause an accident.
If your engine stalls or you cannot
make it to the top of a steep hill,
never attempt to turn around. Your
vehicle could tip or roll over. Always
back straight down in R (Reverse)
range. Never back down in N (Neu-
tral), using only the brake, as this
could cause loss of control.

. Heavy braking going down a hill
could cause your brakes to overheat
and fade, resulting in loss of control
and an accident. Apply brakes lightly
and use a low range to control your
speed.

. Unsecured cargo can be thrown
around when driving over rough
terrain. Properly secure all cargo so
it will not be thrown forward and

cause injury to you or your passen-
gers.

. To avoid raising the center of gravity
excessively, do not exceed the rated
capacity of the roof rack (if so
equipped) and evenly distribute the
load. Secure heavy loads in the cargo
area as far forward and as low as
possible. Do not equip the vehicle
with tires larger than specified in this
manual. This could cause your vehicle
to roll over.

. Do not grip the inside or spokes of the
steering wheel when driving off-
road. The steering wheel could move
suddenly and injure your hands. In-
stead drive with your fingers and
thumbs on the outside of the rim.

. Before operating the vehicle, ensure
that the driver and all passengers
have their seat belts fastened.

. Always drive with the floor mats in

place as the floor may became hot.

. Lower your speed when encountering
strong crosswinds. With a higher
center of gravity, your INFINITI is
more affected by strong side winds.
Slower speeds ensure better vehicle
control.

. Do not drive beyond the performance
capability of the tires, even with
4WD engaged.

. For 4WD equipped vehicles, do not
attempt to raise two wheels off the
ground and shift the transmission to
any drive or reverse position with the
engine running. Doing so may result
in drivetrain damage or unexpected
vehicle movement which could result
in serious vehicle damage or personal
injury.

. Do not attempt to test a 4WD
equipped vehicle on a 2-wheel dy-
namometer (such as the dynam-
ometers used by some states for
emissions testing), or similar equip-
ment even if the other two wheels are
raised off the ground. Make sure you
inform test facility personnel that
your vehicle is equipped with 4WD
before it is placed on a dynamometer.
Using the wrong test equipment may
result in drivetrain damage or unex-
pected vehicle movement which could
result in serious vehicle damage or
personal injury (4WD models).

. When a wheel is off the ground due
to an unlevel surface, do not spin the
wheel excessively.

.

. Accelerating quickly, sharp steering
maneuvers or sudden braking may
cause loss of control.
If at all possible, avoid sharp turning
maneuvers, particularly at high
speeds. Your vehicle has a higher
center of gravity than a conventional
passenger car. The vehicle is not
designed for cornering at the same
speeds as conventional passenger
cars. Failure to operate this vehicle
correctly could result in loss of con-
trol and/or a rollover accident.

. Always use tires of the same type,
size, brand, construction (bias, bias-
belted or radial), and tread pattern
on all four wheels. Install tire chains
on the rear wheels when driving on
slippery roads and drive carefully.

. Be sure to check the brakes immedi-
ately after driving in mud or water.
See “Brake system” (P.5-131) for wet
brakes.

. Avoid parking your vehicle on steep
hills. If you get out of the vehicle and
it rolls forward, backward or side-
ways, you could be injured.

. Whenever you drive off-road
through sand, mud or water as deep
as the wheel hub, more frequent
maintenance may be required. See

Starting and driving 5-11

the maintenance schedules shown in
the "9. Maintenance and schedules"
section.

. Spinning the rear wheels on slippery
surfaces may cause the 4WD warn-
ing light to flash. The 4WD system
may also automatically switch from
the 4WD mode to the 2WD mode.
This could reduce traction. Be espe-
cially careful when towing a trailer
(4WD models).

PUSH-BUTTON IGNITION SWITCH

ENGINE PROTECTION MODE
The engine has an engine protection mode to
reduce the chance of damage if the coolant
temperature becomes too high (for example,
when climbing steep grades in high tem-
perature with heavy loads, such as when
towing a trailer).
When the engine temperature reaches a
certain level:
. The engine coolant temperature gauge

will move toward the H position.

. Engine power may be reduced.
. The air conditioning cooling function may
be automatically turned OFF for a short
time (the blower will continue to oper-
ate).

Engine power and, under some conditions,
vehicle speed will decrease. Vehicle speed
can be controlled with the accelerator pedal,
but the vehicle may not accelerate at the
desired speed. The transmission will down-
shift or upshift as it reaches prescribed shift
points. You can also shift manually.
As driving conditions change and engine
coolant temperature is reduced, vehicle
speed can be increased using the accelerator
pedal, and air conditioning cooling function
will automatically be turned back ON.

If:
1. The engine coolant temperature is not

reduced.

2. The air conditioning cooling function

does not turn back ON.

3. The engine oil pressure warning light

illuminates or engine coolant tempera-
ture gauge does not return to the normal
range from the H position, this may
indicate a malfunction. Move the vehicle
off the road to a safe area and allow the
engine to cool. If after checking the oil
remains on or
and coolant, the
engine coolant temperature does not
return to the normal range, do not
continue to drive.
It is recommended
you contact an INFINITI retailer.

The Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL)
may also come ON. You do not need to have
your vehicle towed, unless it remains on, but
have it inspected soon. It is recommended
you visit an INFINITI retailer for this service.
See “Warning lights,
indicator lights and
audible reminders” (P.2-11).

WARNING

Overheating can result in reduced engine
power and vehicle speed. The reduced
speed may be lower than other traffic,

which could increase the chance of a
collision. Be especially careful when
driving. If the vehicle cannot maintain a
safe driving speed, pull to the side of the
road in a safe area. Allow the engine to
cool and return to normal operation. See
“If your vehicle overheats” (P.6-14).

CAUTION

Running the engine with the engine oil
pressure warning light on could cause
serious damage to the engine almost
immediately. Such damage is not cov-
ered by warranty. Turn off the engine as
soon as it is safe to do so.

CAUTION

. To avoid possible damage to your
vehicle; when stopping the vehicle on
an uphill grade, do not hold the
vehicle by depressing the accelerator
pedal. The foot brake should be used
for this purpose.

. Except in an emergency, do not shift
to the N (Neutral) position while
driving. Coasting with the transmis-
sion in the N (Neutral) position may
cause serious damage to the trans-
mission.

AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION

7 speed automatic transmission
The automatic transmission in your vehicle is
electronically controlled by a transmission
control module to produce maximum effi-
ciency and smooth operation.
Shown on the following pages are the
recommended operating procedures for this
transmission. Follow these procedures for
maximum vehicle performance and driving
enjoyment.

Starting the vehicle
After starting the engine, fully depress the
foot brake pedal and push the shift lever
button before shifting the shift lever to the R
(Reverse), N (Neutral), D (Drive) or Manual
shift mode position. Be sure the vehicle is
fully stopped before attempting to shift the
shift lever.
This automatic transmission model is de-
signed so that the foot brake pedal must be
depressed before shifting from P (Park) to
any drive position while the ignition switch
position is ON.
The shift lever cannot be moved out of the P
(Park) position and into any of the other
gear positions if the ignition switch is
pushed to the LOCK, OFF or ACC position.

5-18 Starting and driving

1. Keep the foot brake pedal depressed and
push the shift lever button to shift into a
driving gear.

2. Release the parking brake and foot
brake, then gradually start the vehicle in
motion.

WARNING

. Do not depress the accelerator pedal
while shifting from P (Park) or N
(Neutral) to R (Reverse), D (Drive) or
manual shift mode. Always depress
the brake pedal until shifting is
completed. Failure to do so could
cause you to lose control and have
an accident.

. Cold engine idle speed is high, so use
caution when shifting into a forward
or reverse gear before the engine has
warmed up.

. Never shift to either P (Park) or R
(Reverse) position while the vehicle is
moving forward and P (Park) or D
(Drive) position while the vehicle is
moving reversing. This could cause an
accident or damage the transmission.
. Do not downshift abruptly on slip-
pery roads. This may cause a loss of
control.

(Park) to R (Reverse), N (Neutral), D (Drive)
or Manual shift mode position.
Push the button to shift into P (Park) or R
(Reverse). All other positions can be selected
without pushing the button.

position to the P (Park) position. Apply the
parking brake. When parking on a hill, apply
the parking brake first, then move the shift
lever to the P (Park) position.

WARNING

Apply the parking brake if the shift lever
is in any position while the engine is not
running. Failure to do so could cause the
vehicle to move unexpectedly or roll
away and result in serious personal
injury or property damage.

CAUTION

Make sure the vehicle is completely
stopped and the transmission is in the
P (Park) position.

P (Park) position:
Use this position when the vehicle is parked
or when starting the engine. Make sure the
vehicle is completely stopped. The brake
pedal must be depressed and the shift lever
button pushed in to move the shift lever
from the N (Neutral) position or any drive

Manual shift mode
When the shift lever is in the manual shift
gate, the transmission is ready for the
manual shift mode. Shift ranges can be
selected manually by moving the shift lever
up or down.
When shifting up, move the shift lever to the
+ (up) side. The transmission shifts to the
higher range.
When shifting down, move the shift lever to
the − (down) side. The transmission shifts to
the lower range.
When canceling the manual shift mode,
return the shift lever to the D (Drive)
position. The transmission returns to the
normal driving mode.

?
/ M3

?
/ M4

?
/ M5

?
/ M6

?
/ M7

M7 (7th):
Use this position for all normal forward
driving at highway speeds.

5-20 Starting and driving

M6 (6th) and M5 (5th):
Use these positions when driving up long
slopes, or for engine braking when driving
down long slopes.
M4 (4th), M3 (3rd) and M2 (2nd):
Use these positions for hill climbing or engine
braking on downhill grades.
M1 (1st):
Use this position when climbing steep hills
slowly or driving slowly through deep snow,
or for maximum engine braking on steep
downhill grades.
. Remember not to drive at high speeds for
extended periods of time in lower than
7th gear. This reduces fuel economy.

. Moving the shift lever rapidly to the same
side twice will shift the ranges in succes-
sion.
In the manual shift mode, the transmis-
sion may not shift to the selected gear
or may automatically shift to the other
gear. This helps maintain driving per-
formance and reduces the chance of
vehicle damage or loss of control.

. When the transmission does not shift to
the selected gear, the Automatic Trans-
mission (AT) position indicator light (in
the vehicle information display) will
blink and the buzzer will sound.

.

.

In the manual shift mode, the transmis-
sion automatically shifts down to 1st
gear before the vehicle comes to a stop.
When accelerating again, it is necessary
to shift up to the desired range.

Accelerator downshift — In D (Drive)
position —
For passing or hill climbing, fully depress the
accelerator pedal to the floor. This shifts the
transmission down into the lower gear,
depending on the vehicle speed.

Fail-safe
When the fail-safe operation occurs, note
that the transmission will be locked in any of
the forward gears according to the condi-
tion.
If the vehicle is driven under extreme
conditions, such as excessive wheel spinning
and subsequent hard braking, the fail-safe
system may be activated. This will occur
even if all electrical circuits are functioning
properly. In this case, push the switch to the
OFF position and wait for 3 seconds. Then
push the ignition switch back to the ON
position. The vehicle should return to its
normal operating condition. If it does not
return to its normal operating condition,
have the transmission checked and re-
paired, if necessary. It is recommended you

visit an INFINITI retailer for this service.

5. Push the shift lever button

and move

the shift lever to N (Neutral) position
while holding down the shift lock.

LANE DEPARTURE WARNING
(LDW)/LANE DEPARTURE
PREVENTION (LDP) (if so equipped)

WARNING

Failure to follow the warnings and
instructions for proper use of the LDW
and LDP systems could result in serious
personal injury or death.
. The LDW and LDP systems will not
steer the vehicle or prevent loss of
control. It is the driver’s responsibility
to stay alert, drive safely, keep the
vehicle in the traveling lane, and be in
control of the vehicle at all times.

. The LDP system may activate if you
change lanes without first activating
your turn signal or, for example, if a
construction zone directs traffic to
cross an existing lane marker. If this
occurs, you may need to apply cor-
rective steering to complete your lane
change.

. Because the LDP system may not
activate under the road, weather,
and lane marker conditions described
in this section, it may not activate
every time your vehicle begins to
leave its lane and you will need to
apply corrective steering.

BLIND SPOT WARNING (BSW) (if
so equipped)

WARNING

Failure to follow the warnings and
instructions for proper use of the BSW
system could result in serious injury or
death.
. The BSW system is not a replacement
for proper driving procedure and is
not designed to prevent contact with
vehicles or objects. When changing
lanes, always use the side and rear
mirrors and turn and look in the
direction your vehicle will move to
ensure it is safe to change lanes.
Never rely solely on the BSW system.
. There is a limitation to the detection
capability of the radar. Not every
moving object or vehicle will be
detected. Using the BSW system
under some road, ground, lane mar-
ker, traffic or weather conditions
could lead to improper system opera-
tion. Always rely on your own opera-
tion to avoid accidents.

The BSW system helps alert the driver of
other vehicles in adjacent lanes when chan-
ging lanes.

. Do not strike or damage the areas around
the camera unit. Do not touch the
camera lens or remove the screw located
on the camera unit. It is recommended
you contact an INFINITI retailer if the
camera unit is damaged due to an
accident.

SSD1030

The radar sensors can detect vehicles on
either side of your vehicle within the detec-
tion zone shown as illustrated. This detec-
tion zone starts from the outside mirror of
your vehicle and extends approximately 10
ft (3.0 m) behind the rear bumper, and
approximately 10 ft (3.0 m) sideways.

Starting and driving 5-33

BSW SYSTEM OPERATION
The BSW system operates above approxi-
mately 20 MPH (32 km/h).
If the radar sensors detect a vehicle in the
detection zone, the side indicator light
illuminates.
If the turn signal
is then activated, the
system chimes (twice) and the side indicator
light flashes. The side indicator light con-
tinues to flash until the detected vehicle
leaves the detection zone.

NOTE:
. The side indicator light illuminates for a
few seconds when the ignition switch is
placed in the ON position.

. The brightness of the side indicator light
is adjusted automatically depending on
the brightness of the ambient light.
If a vehicle comes into the detection zone
after the driver activates the turn
signal, then only the side indicator light
flashes and no chime sounds. For addi-
tional information, refer to “BSW sys-
tem limitations” (P.5-36).

WARNING

Listed below are the system limitations
for the BSW system. Failure to operate
the vehicle in accordance with these
system limitations could result in serious
injury or death.
. The BSW system cannot detect all

vehicles under all conditions.

. The radar sensors may not be able to
detect and activate BSW when cer-
tain objects are present such as:
— Pedestrians, bicycles, animals.

— Vehicles such as motorcycles, low
height vehicles, or high ground
clearance vehicles.

— Oncoming vehicles.

— Vehicles remaining in the detec-
tion zone when you accelerate
from a stop.

— A vehicle merging into an adja-
cent lane at a speed approxi-
mately the same as your vehicle.

— A vehicle approaching rapidly

from behind.

— A vehicle which your vehicle over-

takes rapidly.

— A vehicle that passes through the

detection zone quickly.

. The radar sensor’s detection zone is
designed based on a standard lane
width. When driving in a wider lane,
the radar sensors may not detect
vehicles in an adjacent lane. When
driving in a narrow lane, the radar
sensors may detect vehicles driving
two lanes away.

. The radar sensors are designed to
ignore most stationary objects, how-
ever objects such as guardrails, walls,
foliage and parked vehicles may oc-
casionally be detected. This is a
normal operation condition.

(BSI) (if so equipped)

WARNING

Failure to follow the warnings and
instructions for proper use of the BSI
system could result in serious injury or
death.
. The BSI system is not a replacement
for proper driving procedures and is
not designed to prevent contact with
vehicles or objects. When changing
lanes, always use the side and rear
mirrors and turn and look in the
direction your vehicle will move to
ensure it is safe to change lanes.
Never rely solely on the BSI system.
. There is a limitation to the detection
capability of the radar. Not every
moving object or vehicle will be
detected. Using the BSI system under
some road, ground,
lane marker,
traffic or weather conditions could
lead to improper system operation.
Always rely on your own operation to
avoid accidents.

The BSI system helps alert the driver of other
vehicles in adjacent lanes when changing
lanes and helps assist the driver to return the
vehicle to the center of the traveling lane.

5-42 Starting and driving

JVS1149X

SSD1030

The BSI system uses radar sensors
installed near the rear bumper to detect
other vehicles in an adjacent lane. In addition
to the radar sensors, the BSI system uses a
installed behind the windshield to
camera
monitor the lane markers of your traveling
lane.

Detection zone

The radar sensors can detect vehicles on
either side of your vehicle within the detec-
tion zone shown as illustrated.
This detection zone starts from the outside
mirror of your vehicle and extends approxi-
mately 10 ft (3.0 m) behind the rear bumper,
and approximately 10 ft (3.0 m) sideways.

BSI SYSTEM OPERATION
The BSI system operates above approxi-
mately 37 MPH (60 km/h).
If the radar sensors detect a vehicle in the
detection zone, the side indicator light
illuminates.
If the turn signal
is then activated, the
system chimes (twice) and the side indicator
light flashes. The side indicator light con-
tinues to flash until the detected vehicle
leaves the detection zone.
If the BSI system is ON and your vehicle
approaches a lane marker while another
vehicle is in the detection zone, the system
chimes (three times) and the side indicator
light flashes. Then the BSI system slightly
applies the brakes to help return the vehicle
back to the center of the driving lane. The
BSI system operates regardless of turn
signal usage.

NOTE:
. Warning and system application of the
brakes will only be activated if the side
indicator light is already illuminated
when your vehicle approaches a lane
marker. If another vehicle comes into
the detection zone after your vehicle has
crossed a lane marker, no warning or
system application of the brakes will be
activated. (See “BSI driving situations”

(LDP) and Distance Control Assist (DCA)
systems. When the dynamic driver assis-
is pushed, the LDP and DCA
tance switch
systems will also turn on or off simulta-
neously. The BSI system can be individually
set to on or off on the center display using
the center multi-function control panel
If the system is set to off, the system will not
turn on even if the dynamic driver assistance
is pushed to on. To set the system

BSI SYSTEM LIMITATIONS

WARNING

Listed below are the system limitations
for the BSI system. Failure to operate
the vehicle in accordance with these
system limitations could result in serious
injury or death.
. The BSI system cannot detect all

vehicles under all conditions.

. The radar sensors may not be able to
detect and activate BSI when certain
objects are present such as:
— Pedestrians, bicycles, animals.

— Vehicles such as motorcycles, low
height vehicles, or high ground
clearance vehicles.

— Vehicles remaining in the detec-
tion zone when you accelerate
from a stop.

— Oncoming vehicles.

— A vehicle merging into an adja-
cent lane at a speed approxi-
mately the same as your vehicle.

— A vehicle approaching rapidly

from behind.

— A vehicle which your vehicle over-

takes rapidly.

— A vehicle that passes through the

detection zone quickly.

. The radar sensor’s detection zone is
designed based on a standard lane
width. When driving in a wider lane,
the radar sensors may not detect
vehicles in an adjacent lane. When
driving in a narrow lane, the radar
sensors may detect vehicles driving
two lanes away.

. The radar sensors are designed to
ignore most stationary objects, how-
ever objects such as guardrails, walls,
foliage and parked vehicles may oc-
casionally be detected. This is a
normal operation condition.

. The camera may not detect lane
markers in the following situations
and the BSI system may not operate
properly.
— On roads where there are multi-
ple parallel
lane
markers that are faded or not
painted clearly; yellow painted
lane markers; non-standard lane
markers;
lane markers covered
with water, dirt, snow, etc.

INTELLIGENT CRUISE CONTROL
(ICC) (if so equipped)

WARNING

Failure to follow the warnings and
instructions for proper use of the ICC
system could result in serious injury or
death.
.

ICC is not a collision avoidance or
warning device. For highway use only
and it is not intended for congested
areas or city driving. Failure to apply
the brakes could result in an accident.
. Always observe posted speed limits
and do not set the speed over them.
. Always drive carefully and atten-
tively when using either cruise con-
trol mode. Read and understand the
Owner’s Manual thoroughly before
using the cruise control. To avoid
serious injury or death, do not rely
on the system to prevent accidents or
to control the vehicle’s speed in
emergency situations. Do not use
cruise control except in appropriate
road and traffic conditions.
In the conventional (fixed speed)
cruise control mode, a warning chime
will not sound to warn you if you are
too close to the vehicle ahead. Pay
special attention to the distance
between your vehicle and the vehicle

.

ahead of you or a collision could
occur.

The ICC system maintains a selected dis-
tance from the vehicle in front of you within
the speed range of 0 to 90 MPH (0 to 144
km/h) up to the set speed. The set speed can
be selected by the driver between 20 to 90
MPH (32 to 144 km/h).
The vehicle travels at a set speed when the
road ahead is clear.
The ICC system can be set to one of two
cruise control modes.
. Vehicle-to-vehicle distance control

mode:
For maintaining a selected distance
between your vehicle and the vehicle in
front of you up to the preset speed.

. Conventional (fixed speed) cruise control

mode:
For cruising at a preset speed.

VEHICLE-TO-VEHICLE DIS-
TANCE CONTROL MODE
In the vehicle-to-vehicle distance control
mode, the ICC system automatically main-
tains a selected distance from the vehicle
traveling in front of you according to that
vehicle’s speed (up to the set speed), or at
the set speed when the road ahead is clear.

Vehicle-to-vehicle distance control
mode operation
The vehicle-to-vehicle distance control
mode is designed to maintain a selected
distance and reduce the speed to match the
slower vehicle ahead; the system will de-
celerate the vehicle as necessary and if the
vehicle ahead comes to a stop, the vehicle
decelerates to a standstill. However, the ICC
system can only apply up to approximately
40% of the vehicle’s total braking power.
This system should only be used when traffic
conditions allow vehicle speeds to remain
fairly constant or when vehicle speeds
change gradually. If a vehicle moves into
the traveling lane ahead or if a vehicle
traveling ahead rapidly decelerates, the
distance between vehicles may become
closer because the ICC system cannot
decelerate the vehicle quickly enough. If this
occurs, the ICC system will sound a warning
chime and blink the system display to notify
the driver to take necessary action.
The system will cancel and a warning chime
will sound if the speed is below approxi-
mately 15 MPH (24 km/h) and a vehicle is
not detected ahead. The system will also
disengage when the vehicle goes above the
maximum set speed.
See “Approach warning” (P.5-76).

The following items are controlled in the
vehicle-to-vehicle distance control mode:
. When there are no vehicles traveling
ahead, the vehicle-to-vehicle distance
control mode maintains the speed set
by the driver. The set speed range is
between approximately 20 and 90 MPH
(32 and 144 km/h).

. When there is a vehicle traveling ahead,
the vehicle-to-vehicle distance control
mode adjusts the speed to maintain the
distance, selected by driver, from the
vehicle ahead. The adjusting speed range
is up to the set speed. If the vehicle
ahead comes to a stop, the vehicle
decelerates to a standstill within the
limitations of the system. The system
will cancel once it judges a standstill with
a warning chime.

. When the vehicle traveling ahead has
moved out from its lane of travel, the
vehicle-to-vehicle distance control mode
accelerates and maintains vehicle speed
up to the set speed.

The ICC system does not control vehicle
speed or warn you when you approach
stationary and slow moving vehicles. You
must pay attention to vehicle operation to
maintain proper distance from vehicles
ahead when approaching toll gates or traffic
congestion.

Vehicle-to-vehicle distance control
mode limitations

WARNING

.

Listed below are the system limitations
for the ICC system. Failure to operate
the vehicle in accordance with these
system limitations could result in serious
injury or death.
. The system is primarily intended for
use on straight, dry, open roads with
light traffic. It is not advisable to use
the system in city traffic or con-
gested areas.

. This system will not adapt automati-
cally to road conditions. This system
should be used in evenly flowing
traffic. Do not use the system on
roads with sharp curves, or on icy
roads, in heavy rain or in fog.

. As there is a performance limit to the
distance control function, never rely
solely on the ICC system. This system
does not correct careless, inattentive
or absent-minded driving, or over-

come poor visibility in rain, fog, or
other bad weather. Decelerate the
vehicle speed by depressing the brake
pedal, depending on the distance to
the vehicle ahead and the surround-
ing circumstances in order to main-
tain a safe distance between vehicles.
If the vehicle ahead comes to a stop,
the vehicle decelerates to a standstill
within the limitations of the system.
The system will cancel once it judges
that the vehicle has come to a
standstill and sound a warning chime.
To prevent the vehicle from moving,
the driver must depress the brake
pedal.

. Always pay attention to the opera-
tion of the vehicle and be ready to
manually control the proper follow-
ing distance. The vehicle-to-vehicle
distance control mode of the ICC
system may not be able to maintain
the selected distance between vehi-
cles (following distance) or selected
vehicle speed under some circum-
stances.

. Normally when controlling the dis-
tance to a vehicle ahead, this system
automatically accelerates or decele-
rates your vehicle according to the
speed of the vehicle ahead. Depress

Starting and driving 5-77

the accelerator to properly accelerate
your vehicle when acceleration is
required for a lane change. Depress
the brake pedal when deceleration is
required to maintain a safe distance
to the vehicle ahead due to its sudden
braking or if a vehicle cuts in. Always
stay alert when using the ICC system.
. The system may not detect the
vehicle in front of you in certain road
or weather conditions. To avoid ac-
cidents, never use the ICC system
under the following conditions:
— On roads where the traffic is
heavy or there are sharp curves

— On slippery road surfaces such as

on ice or snow, etc.

— During bad weather (rain, fog,

snow, etc.)

— When rain, snow or dirt adhere to

the system sensor

— On steep downhill roads (the
vehicle may go beyond the set
vehicle speed and frequent brak-
ing may result in overheating the
brakes)

— On repeated uphill and downhill

roads

.

— When traffic conditions make it
difficult to keep a proper distance
between vehicles because of fre-
quent acceleration or deceleration
. Do not use the ICC system if you are
towing a trailer. The system may not
detect a vehicle ahead.
In some road or traffic conditions, a
vehicle or object can unexpectedly
come into the sensor detection zone
and cause automatic braking. You
may need to control the distance
from other vehicles using the accel-
erator pedal. Always stay alert and
avoid using the ICC system when it is
not recommended in this section.

The radar sensor will not detect the follow-
ing objects:
. Stationary and slow moving vehicles
. Pedestrians or objects in the roadway
. Oncoming vehicles in the same lane
. Motorcycles traveling offset in the travel

lane

The sensor generally detects the signals
returned from the vehicle ahead. Therefore,
if the sensor cannot detect the reflection
from the vehicle ahead, the ICC system may
not maintain the selected distance.
The following are some conditions in which

the sensor cannot detect the signals:
. When the snow or road spray from
traveling vehicles reduces the sensor’s
visibility

. When excessively heavy baggage is
loaded in the rear seat or the luggage
area of your vehicle

. When your vehicle is towing a trailer, etc.
The ICC system is designed to automatically
check the sensor’s operation within the
limitation of the system. When the sensor
is covered with dirt or is obstructed, the
system will automatically be canceled. If the
sensor is covered with ice, a transparent or
translucent vinyl bag, etc., the ICC system
may not detect them. In these instances, the
vehicle-to-vehicle distance control mode
may not cancel and may not be able to
maintain the selected following distance
from the vehicle ahead. Be sure to check
and clean the sensor regularly.

control the proper distance away from
vehicle traveling ahead.

SSD0252

The detection zone of the ICC sensor is
limited. A vehicle ahead must be in the
detection zone for the vehicle-to-vehicle
distance detection mode to maintain the
selected distance from the vehicle ahead.
A vehicle ahead may move outside of the
detection zone due to its position within the
same lane of travel. Motorcycles may not be

DCA SYSTEM OPERATION

WARNING

Failure to follow the warnings and
instructions for proper use of the DCA
system could result in serious personal
injury or death.
. When the vehicle ahead detection
indicator light is not illuminated,
system will not control the vehicle
or warn the driver.

. Never place your foot under the
brake pedal. Your foot may be caught
when the system controls the brake.
. Depending on the position of the
accelerator pedal, the system may
not be able to assist the driver to
release the accelerator pedal appro-
priately.

The DCA system brakes and moves the
accelerator pedal upward according to the
distance from and the relative speed of the
vehicle ahead to help assist the driver in
maintaining a following distance. The sys-
tem will decelerate as necessary and if the
vehicle ahead comes to a stop, the vehicle
decelerates to a standstill. However, the
DCA system can only apply up to approxi-

mately 40% of the vehicle’s total braking
power. If a vehicle moves into the traveling
lane ahead or if a vehicle traveling ahead
rapidly decelerates, the distance between
vehicles may become closer because the
DCA system cannot decelerate the vehicle
quickly enough.
If this occurs, the DCA
system will sound a warning chime and blink
the system display to notify the driver to
take necessary action.
See “Approach warning” (P.5-91).

The DCA system helps assist the driver to
keep a following distance to the vehicle
ahead by braking and moving the accelera-
tor pedal upward in the normal driving
condition.
When a vehicle ahead is detected:
The vehicle ahead detection indicator comes
on.
When the vehicle approaches a vehicle
ahead:
.

If the driver’s foot is not on the accel-
erator pedal, the system activates the

brakes to decelerate smoothly as neces-
sary. If the vehicle ahead comes to a
stop, the vehicle decelerates to a stand-
still within the limitations of the system.
If the driver’s foot is on the accelerator
pedal, the system moves the accelerator
pedal upward to assist the driver to
release the accelerator pedal.

.

When brake operation by the driver is
required:
The system alerts the driver by a warning
chime and blinking the vehicle ahead detec-
tion indicator. If the driver’s foot is on the
accelerator pedal after the warning, the
system moves the accelerator pedal upward
to assist the driver to switch to the brake

pedal.

NOTE:
. The stop lights of the vehicle come on
when braking is performed by the DCA
system.

. When the brake operates, a noise may be
heard and/or vibration may be felt. This
is not a malfunction.

Overriding the system:
The following driver’s operation overrides
the system operation.
. When the driver depresses the accelera-
tor pedal even further while the system is
moving the accelerator pedal upward,
the DCA system control of the accel-
erator pedal is canceled.

. When the driver’s foot is on the accel-
erator pedal, the brake control by the
system is not operated.

. When the driver’s foot is on the brake
pedal, neither the brake control nor the
alert by the system operates.

. When the Intelligent Cruise Control (ICC)
system is set, the DCA system will be
cancelled.

Approach warning
If your vehicle comes closer to the vehicle
ahead due to rapid deceleration of that
vehicle or if another vehicle cuts in, the

system warns the driver with the chime and
DCA system display. Decelerate by depres-
sing the brake pedal to maintain a safe
vehicle distance if:
. The chime sounds.
. The vehicle ahead detection indicator

blinks.

The warning chime may not sound in some
cases when there is a short distance be-
tween vehicles. Some examples are:
. When the vehicles are traveling at the
same speed and the distance between
vehicles is not changing

. When the vehicle ahead is traveling
faster and the distance between vehicles
is increasing

. When a vehicle cuts in near your vehicle
The warning chime will not sound when your
vehicle approaches vehicles that are parked
or moving slowly.

NOTE:
The approach warning chime may sound
and the system display may blink when the
radar sensor detects objects on the side of
the vehicle or on the side of the road. This
may cause the DCA system to decelerate or
accelerate the vehicle. The radar sensor may
detect these objects when the vehicle is
driven on winding roads, narrow roads, hilly
roads or when entering or exiting a curve. In

these cases you will have to manually
control the proper distance ahead of your
vehicle.
Also, the sensor sensitivity can be affected
by vehicle operation (steering maneuver or
driving position in the lane) or traffic or
vehicle condition (for example, if a vehicle is
being driven with some damage).

FEB WITH PEDESTRIAN DETEC-
TION SYSTEM OPERATION
The FEB with pedestrian detection system
operates at speeds above approximately 3
MPH (5 km/h).
For the pedestrian detection function, the
FEB with pedestrian detection system oper-
ates at speeds between 6 – 37 MPH (10 –
60 km/h).
If a risk of a forward collision with a vehicle is
detected, the FEB with pedestrian detection
system will firstly provide the warning to the
driver by blinking the vehicle ahead detection
indicator in the vehicle information display
and providing an audible alert. In addition,
the FEB with pedestrian detection system
pushes the accelerator pedal up. If the driver
releases the accelerator pedal, then the
system applies partial braking. If the driver
applies the brakes quickly and forcefully, but
the FEB with pedestrian detection system
detects that there is still the possibility of a
forward collision, the system will automati-
cally increase the braking force.
If the risk of a forward collision becomes
imminent and the driver does not take
action, the FEB with pedestrian detection
system issues the second visual (flashing)
and audible alert, and then automatically
applies harder braking.

. When the steering wheel is turned as far

as necessary to avoid a collision.

. When the accelerator pedal is depressed.
. When there is no longer a vehicle or

pedestrian detected ahead.

If the FEB with pedestrian detection system
has stopped the vehicle, the vehicle will
remain at a standstill for approximately 2
seconds before the brakes are released.

If a risk of a forward impact with a
pedestrian is detected, the FEB with pedes-
trian detection system issues the second
visual (flashing) and audible alert , and the
system will apply partial braking. If the driver
applies the brakes quickly and forcefully but
the FEB with pedestrian detection system
detects that there is still the possibility of a
forward impact with a pedestrian, the
system will automatically increase the brak-
ing force. If the risk of collision becomes
imminent and the driver does not take
action, the FEB with pedestrian detection
system automatically applies harder braking.

NOTE:
The vehicle’s stop lights come on when
braking is performed by the FEB with
pedestrian detection system.
Depending on vehicle speed and distance to
the vehicle or pedestrian ahead, as well as
driving and roadway conditions, the system
may help the driver avoid a forward collision
or may help mitigate the consequences of a
collision should one be unavoidable.
If the driver is handling the steering wheel,
accelerating or braking, the FEB with pe-
destrian detection system will function later
or will not function.
The automatic braking will cease under the
following conditions:

FUEL EFFICIENT DRIVING TIPS

CAUTION

During the first 1,200 miles (2,000 km),
follow these recommendations to obtain
maximum engine performance and en-
sure the future reliability and economy
of your new vehicle.

Failure to follow these recommendations
may result in shortened engine life and
reduced engine performance.

. Avoid driving for long periods at constant
speed, either fast or slow. Do not run the
engine over 4,000 rpm.

. Do not accelerate at full throttle in any

gear.

. Avoid quick starts.
. Avoid hard braking as much as possible.
. Do not tow a trailer for the first 500

miles (805 km).

Follow these easy-to-use Fuel Efficient
Driving Tips to help you achieve the most
fuel economy from your vehicle.
1. Use smooth accelerator and brake pedal

application.
. Avoid rapid starts and stops.
. Use smooth, gentle accelerator and
brake application whenever possible.
. Maintain constant speed while com-
muting and coast whenever possible.

2. Maintain constant speed.

. Look ahead to try and anticipate and

minimize stops.

. Synchronizing your speed with traffic
lights allows you to reduce your
number of stops.

. Maintaining a steady speed can mini-
mize red light stops and improve fuel
efficiency.

3. Use air conditioning (A/C) at higher

vehicle speeds.
. Below 40 MPH (64 km/h), it is more
efficient to open windows to cool the
vehicle due to reduced engine load.

. Above 40 MPH (64 km/h), it is more
efficient to use A/C to cool the
vehicle due to increased aerodynamic
drag.

. Recirculating the cool air in the cabin
when the A/C is on reduces cooling
load.

4. Drive at economical speeds and dis-

tances.
. Observing the speed limit and not
exceeding 60 MPH (97 km/h) (where
legally allowed) can improve fuel
efficiency due to reduced aerody-
namic drag.

. Maintaining a safe following distance
behind other vehicles reduces unne-
cessary braking.

. Safely monitoring traffic to anticipate
changes in speed permits reduced
braking and smooth acceleration
changes.

. Select a gear range suitable to road

conditions.

5. Use cruise control.

. Using cruise control during highway
driving helps maintain a steady speed.
. Cruise control is particularly effective
in providing fuel savings when driving
on flat terrains.

6. Plan for the shortest route.

. Utilize a map or navigation system to
determine the best route to save time.

7. Avoid idling.

. Shutting off your engine when safe
for stops exceeding 30-60 seconds
saves fuel and reduces emissions.

Starting and driving 5-119

8. Buy an automated pass for toll roads.

. Automated passes permit drivers to
use special lanes to maintain cruising
speed through the toll and avoid
stopping and starting.

9. Winter warm up.

. Limit idling time to minimize impact to

fuel economy.

. Vehicles typically need no more than
30 seconds of idling at start-up to
effectively circulate the engine oil
before driving.

. Your vehicle will reach its ideal oper-
ating temperature more quickly while
driving versus idling.

10. Keeping your vehicle cool.

. Park your vehicle in a covered parking
area or in the shade whenever possi-
ble.

. When entering a hot vehicle, opening
the windows will help to reduce the
inside temperature faster, resulting in
reduced demand on your A/C system.

INCREASING FUEL ECONOMY

INFINITI ALL-MODE 4WD® (if so equipped)

. Keep your engine tuned up.
. Follow the recommended scheduled

maintenance.

. Keep the tires inflated to the correct
pressure. Low tire pressure increases tire
wear and lowers fuel economy.

. Keep the wheels in correct alignment.
Improper alignment increases tire wear
and lowers fuel economy.

. Use the recommended viscosity engine
oil. (See “Engine oil and oil filter recom-
mendation” (P.10-6).)

WARNING

. Do not attempt to raise two wheels
off the ground and shift the trans-
mission to any drive or reverse posi-
tion with the engine running. Doing
so may result in drivetrain damage or
unexpected vehicle movement which
could result in serious vehicle damage
or personal injury.

. Do not attempt to test a 4WD
equipped vehicle on a 2-wheel dy-
namometer or similar equipment even
if the other two wheels are raised off
the ground. Make sure you inform
test facility personnel that your ve-
hicle is equipped with 4WD before it
is placed on a dynamometer. Using
the wrong test equipment may result
in drivetrain damage or unexpected
vehicle movement which could result
in serious vehicle damage or personal
injury.

nately, the vehicle may move unex-
pectedly.

CAUTION

. Never shift the 4WD shift switch

between 4L and 4H while driving.

. The 4HI position provides greater
traction. Avoid excessive speed, as it
will cause increased fuel consumption
and higher oil temperatures, and
could damage drivetrain component.
Speeds over 62 MPH (100 km/h) in
4HI is not recommended.

. The 4LO position provides maximum
traction. Avoid raising vehicle speed
excessively, as the maximum speed is
approximately 31 MPH (50 km/h).

. When driving straight, shift the 4WD
shift switch to the AUTO or 4H
position. Do not move the 4WD shift
switch when making a turn or rever-
sing.

. Do not shift the 4WD shift switch
(between AUTO and 4H) while driv-
ing on steep downhill grades. Use the
engine brake and low automatic
transmission gears for engine brak-
ing.

. Do not operate the 4WD shift switch
(between AUTO and 4H) with the
rear wheels spinning.

. Do not drive on dry hard surface
roads in the 4HI or 4LO position.
Driving on dry hard surfaces in 4HI or
4LO may cause unnecessary noise
and tire wear. INFINITI recommends
driving in the AUTO position under
these conditions.

. The 4WD transfer case may not be
shifted between 4HI and 4LO at low
ambient temperatures and the 4LO
and 4HI indicators may blink even
when the 4WD shift switch is shifted.
After driving for a while you can
change the 4WD shift switch be-
tween 4H and 4L.

When driving on rough roads,
. Drive carefully according to the road

surface conditions.

When the vehicle is stuck,
. Place stones or wooden blocks under the

tires to free the vehicle.

. Set the 4WD shift switch to 4H or 4L.
.

If it is difficult to free the vehicle, repeat
forward and backward movement to
increase the movement.

.

If the vehicle is stuck deep in mud, tire
chains may be effective.

CAUTION

. Do not spin the tires excessively.
Tires will sink deep into the mud,
making it difficult to free the vehicle.
. Avoid shifting gears with the engine
running at high speeds as this may
cause malfunction.

because of a malfunction.

CAUTION

. When driving straight, shift the 4WD
shift switch to the AUTO or 4H
position. Do not move the 4WD shift
switch when making a turn or rever-
sing.
If the 4WD shift switch is
operated while making a turn, accel-
erating or decelerating or if the
ignition switch is placed in the OFF
position while in the AUTO, 4H or 4L,
you may feel a jolt. This is not a
malfunction.

. Do not shift the 4WD shift switch
while driving on steep downhill
grades. Use the engine brake and
low automatic transmission gears
for engine braking.

. Do not operate the 4WD shift switch

with the rear wheels spinning.

. Before placing the 4WD shift switch
in the 4H position from AUTO,
ensure the vehicle speed is less than
62 MPH (100 km/h). Failure to do so
can damage the 4WD system.

. Never shift the 4WD shift switch

shifting from one drive mode to the
other. When the shifting is completed,

If the 4WD warning light comes on, the
4WD shift indicator turns off.
High-temperature transfer case oil makes
the 4WD warning light blink rapidly (about
twice per second). If the warning light blinks
rapidly during operation, stop the vehicle in a
safe place immediately. Then if the light
turns off after a while, you can continue
driving.
A large difference between the diameters of
front and rear wheels will make the 4WD
warning light blink slowly (about once per
two seconds). Change the 4WD shift switch
to AUTO and do not drive fast.

CAUTION

.

If the 4WD warning light comes on or
blinks slowly during operation or
rapidly after stopping the vehicle for

HILL START ASSIST SYSTEM

WARNING

. Never rely solely on the hill start
assist system to prevent the vehicle
from moving backward on a hill.
Always drive carefully and atten-
tively. Depress the brake pedal when
the vehicle is stopped on a steep hill.
Be especially careful when stopped
on a hill on frozen or muddy roads.
Failure to prevent the vehicle from
rolling backwards may result in a loss
of control of the vehicle and possible
serious injury or death.

. The hill start assist system is not
designed to hold the vehicle at a
standstill on a hill. Depress the brake
pedal when the vehicle is stopped on
a steep hill. Failure to do so may
cause the vehicle to roll backwards
and may result in a collision or serious
personal injury.

. The hill start assist system may not
prevent the vehicle from rolling back-
wards on a hill under all load or road
conditions. Always be prepared to
depress the brake pedal to prevent
the vehicle from rolling backwards.
Failure to do so may result in a
collision or serious personal injury.

5-128 Starting and driving

The hill start assist system automatically
keeps the brakes applied to help prevent the
vehicle from rolling backwards in the time it
takes the driver to release the brake pedal
and apply the accelerator when the vehicle is
stopped on a hill.
The hill start assist system will operate
automatically under the following condi-
tions:
. The transmission is shifted to a forward

or reverse gear.

. The vehicle is stopped completely on a hill

by applying the brake.

The maximum holding time is 2 seconds.
After 2 seconds the vehicle will begin to roll
back and the hill start assist system will stop
operating completely.
The hill start assist system will not operate
when the transmission is shifted to the N
(Neutral) or P (Park) position or on a flat and
level road.
When the Vehicle Dynamic Control (VDC)
warning light illuminates in the meter, the hill
start assist system will not operate. (See
“Warning lights, indicator lights and audible
reminders” (P.2-11).)

PARKING/PARKING ON HILLS

WARNING

. Do not stop or park the vehicle over
flammable materials such as dry
grass, waste paper or rags. They
may ignite and cause a fire.

. Never leave the engine running while

the vehicle is unattended.

. Do not leave children unattended
inside the vehicle. They could un-
knowingly activate switches or con-
trols. Unattended children could
become involved in serious accidents.

SD1006MA

. To help avoid risk of injury or death
through unintended operation of the
vehicle and/or its systems, do not
leave children, people who require the
assistance of others or pets unat-
tended in your vehicle. Additionally,
the temperature inside a closed ve-
hicle on a warm day can quickly
become high enough to cause a sig-
nificant risk of injury or death to
people and pets.

. Safe parking procedures require that
both the parking brake be applied
and the transmission be placed in the
P (Park) position. Failure to do so

could cause the vehicle to move
unexpectedly or roll away and result
in an accident.

. Make sure the automatic transmis-
sion shift lever has been pushed as far
forward as it can go and cannot be
moved without depressing the foot
brake pedal.

1. Firmly apply the parking brake.
2. Move the shift lever to the P (Park)

position.

3. To help prevent the vehicle from rolling
into the street when parked on a sloping
drive way, it is a good practice to turn the
wheels as illustrated.
. HEADED DOWNHILL WITH CURB:

Turn the wheels into the curb and move
the vehicle forward until the curb side
wheel gently touches the curb.
. HEADED UPHILL WITH CURB:
Turn the wheels away from the curb and
move the vehicle back until the curb side
wheel gently touches the curb.
. HEADED UPHILL OR DOWNHILL,

NO CURB:

Turn the wheels toward the side of the
road so the vehicle will move away from
the center of the road if it moves.

POWER STEERING

BRAKE SYSTEM

WARNING

If the engine is not running or is turned
off while driving, the power assist for
the steering will not work. Steering will
be harder to operate.

The power assisted steering uses a hydraulic
pump, driven by the engine, to assist steer-
ing.
If the engine stops or the drive belt breaks,
you will still have control of the vehicle.
However, much greater steering effort is
needed, especially in sharp turns and at low
speeds.

BRAKING PRECAUTIONS
The brake system has two separate hydrau-
lic circuits. If one circuit malfunctions, you
will still have braking ability at two wheels.
You may feel a small click and hear a sound
when the brake pedal
is fully depressed
slowly. This is not a malfunction and in-
dicates that the brake assist mechanism is
operating properly.

Hydraulically-assisted brakes
The hydraulically-assisted brake system is
designed to use a hydraulic pump driven
electrically, to assist braking. If the engine
stops, you can stop the vehicle by depressing
the foot brake pedal. However, greater foot
pressure on the foot brake pedal will be
required to stop the vehicle. The stopping
distance will be longer.

Wet brakes
When the vehicle is washed or driven
through water, the brakes may get wet. As
a result, your braking distance will be longer
and the vehicle may pull to one side during
braking.
To dry brakes, drive the vehicle at a safe
speed while lightly tapping the brake pedal
to heat-up the brakes. Do this until the
brakes return to normal. Avoid driving the
vehicle at high speeds until the brakes

function correctly.

PARKING BRAKE BREAK-IN
Break in the parking brake shoes whenever
the stopping effect of the parking brake is
weakened or whenever the parking brake
shoes and/or drums/rotors are replaced, in
order to assure the best braking perfor-
mance.
This procedure is described in the vehicle
service manual. It is recommended you visit
an INFINITI retailer for this service.

Using the brakes
Avoid resting your foot on the brake pedal
while driving. This will cause overheating of
the brakes, wearing out the brake and pads
faster and reduce gas mileage.
To help save the brakes and to prevent the
brakes from overheating, reduce speed and
downshift to a lower gear before going
down a slope or long grade. Overheated
brakes may reduce braking performance and
could result in loss of vehicle control.

WARNING

. While driving on a slippery surface,
be careful when braking, accelerating
or downshifting. Abrupt braking or
accelerating could cause the wheels

to skid and result in an accident.
If the engine is not running or is
turned off while driving, the power
assist for the brakes will not work.
Braking will be harder.

BRAKE ASSIST
When the force applied to the brake pedal
exceeds a certain level, the Brake Assist is

faces will be longer than on normal
surfaces even with ABS. Stopping
distances may also be longer on
rough, gravel or snow covered roads,
or if you are using tire chains. Always
maintain a safe distance from the
vehicle in front of you. Ultimately,
the driver is responsible for safety.

. Tire type and condition may also

affect braking effectiveness.
— When replacing tires, install the
specified size of tires on all four
wheels.

— When installing a spare tire, make
sure that it is the proper size and
type as specified on the Tire and
Loading Information label. See
“Tire and loading information la-
bel” (P.10-13).

— For detailed information, see

“Wheels and tires” (P.8-27).

The Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) controls
the brakes so the wheels do not lock during
hard braking or when braking on slippery
surfaces. The system detects the rotation
speed at each wheel and varies the brake
fluid pressure to prevent each wheel from
locking and sliding. By preventing each
wheel from locking, the system helps the

WARNING

The Brake Assist is only an aid to assist
braking operation and is not a collision
warning or avoidance device. It is the
driver’s responsibility to stay alert, drive
safely and be in control of the vehicle at
all times.

ANTI-LOCK BRAKING SYSTEM
(ABS)

WARNING

. The Anti-lock Braking System (ABS)
is a sophisticated device, but it
cannot prevent accidents resulting
from careless or dangerous driving
techniques. It can help maintain ve-
hicle control during braking on slip-
pery surfaces. Remember that
stopping distances on slippery sur-

5-132 Starting and driving

driver maintain steering control and helps to
minimize swerving and spinning on slippery
surfaces.

Using the system
Depress the brake pedal and hold it down.
Depress the brake pedal with firm steady
pressure, but do not pump the brakes. The
ABS will operate to prevent the wheels from
locking up. Steer the vehicle to avoid
obstacles.

WARNING

Do not pump the brake pedal. Doing so
may result in increased stopping dis-
tances.

Self-test feature
The ABS includes electronic sensors, electric
pumps, hydraulic solenoids and a computer.
The computer has a built-in diagnostic
feature that tests the system each time you
start the engine and move the vehicle at a
low speed in forward or reverse. When the
self-test occurs, you may hear a “clunk”
noise and/or feel a pulsation in the brake
pedal. This is normal and does not indicate a
malfunction. If the computer senses a mal-
function,
it switches the ABS off and

illuminates the ABS warning light on the
instrument panel. The brake system then
operates normally, but without anti-lock
assistance.
If the ABS warning light illuminates during
the self-test or while driving, have the
vehicle checked. It is recommended you visit
an INFINITI retailer for this service.

Normal operation
The ABS operates at speeds above 3 to 6
MPH (5 to 10 km/h). The speed varies
according to road conditions.
When the ABS senses that one or more
wheels are close to locking up, the actuator
rapidly applies and releases hydraulic pres-
sure. This action is similar to pumping the
brakes very quickly. You may feel a pulsation
in the brake pedal and hear a noise from
under the hood or feel a vibration from the
actuator when it is operating. This is normal
and indicates that the ABS is operating
properly. However, the pulsation may indi-
cate that road conditions are hazardous and
extra care is required while driving.

VEHICLE DYNAMIC CONTROL
(VDC) SYSTEM

The Vehicle Dynamic Control (VDC) system
uses various sensors to monitor driver inputs
and vehicle motion. Under certain driving
conditions, the VDC system helps to perform
the following functions.
. Controls brake pressure to reduce wheel
slip on one slipping drive wheel so power
is transferred to a non slipping drive
wheel on the same axle.

. Controls brake pressure and engine out-
put to reduce drive wheel slip based on
vehicle speed (traction control function).
. Controls brake pressure at individual
wheels and engine output to help the
driver maintain control of the vehicle in
the following conditions:
— understeer (vehicle tends to not follow
the steered path despite increased
steering input)

— oversteer (vehicle tends to spin due to

certain road or driving conditions).

The VDC system can help the driver to
maintain control of the vehicle, but it cannot
prevent loss of vehicle control in all driving
situations.
When the VDC system operates, the VDC

illuminates (for 4WD models).
See “Vehicle Dynamic Control (VDC) warn-
ing light” (P.2-18) and “Vehicle Dynamic
Control (VDC) off indicator light” (P.2-21).

5-134 Starting and driving

The computer has a built-in diagnostic
feature that tests the system each time you
start the engine and move the vehicle
forward or in reverse at a slow speed. When
the self-test occurs, you may hear a “clunk”
noise and/or feel a pulsation in the brake
pedal. This is normal and is not an indication
of a malfunction.

WARNING

. The VDC system is designed to help
improve driving stability but does not
prevent accidents due to abrupt
steering operation at high speeds or
by careless or dangerous driving
techniques. Reduce vehicle speed
and be especially careful when driving
and cornering on slippery surfaces
and always drive carefully.

. Do not modify the vehicle’s suspen-
sion.
If suspension parts such as
shock absorbers, struts, springs, sta-
bilizer bars, bushings and wheels are
not INFINITI recommended for your
vehicle or are extremely deteriorated,
the VDC system may not operate

INFINITI
recommends the use of MUD & SNOW or
ALL SEASON tires on all four wheels. It is
recommended you consult an INFINITI re-
tailer for the tire type, size, speed rating and
availability information.
For additional traction on icy roads, studded
tires may be used. However, some U.S.
states and Canadian provinces prohibit their
use. Check local, state and provincial laws
before installing studded tires.
Skid and traction capabilities of studded
snow tires, on wet or dry surfaces, may be
poorer than that of non-studded snow tires.
Tire chains may be used. For details, see
“Tire chains” (P.8-33).

For four-wheel drive
If you install snow tires, they must also be
the same size, brand, construction and tread
pattern on all four wheels.

SPECIAL WINTER EQUIPMENT
It is recommended that the following items
be carried in the vehicle during winter:
. A scraper and stiff-bristled brush to
remove ice and snow from the windows
and wiper blades.

. A sturdy, flat board to be placed under

the jack to give it firm support.

. A shovel to dig the vehicle out of

reservoir tank.

DRIVING ON SNOW OR ICE

WARNING

. Wet ice (32°F, 0°C and freezing rain),
very cold snow or ice can be slick and
very hard to drive on. The vehicle will
have much less traction or “grip”
under these conditions. Try to avoid
driving on wet ice until the road is
salted or sanded.

. Whatever the condition, drive with
caution. Accelerate and slow down
with care. If accelerating or down-
shifting too fast, the drive wheels will
lose even more traction.

. Allow more stopping distance under
these conditions. Braking should be
started sooner than on dry pave-
ment.

. Allow greater following distances on

slippery roads.

. Watch for slippery spots (glare ice).
These may appear on an otherwise
clear road in shaded areas. If a patch
of ice is seen ahead, brake before
reaching it. Try not to brake while on
the ice, and avoid any sudden steer-
ing maneuvers.

. Do not use the cruise control on

slippery roads.

. Snow can trap dangerous exhaust
gases under your vehicle. Keep snow
clear of the exhaust pipe and from
around your vehicle.

ENGINE BLOCK HEATER (if so
equipped)
Engine block heaters are used to assist in
cold temperature starting.
The engine block heater should be used
when the outside temperature is 20°F
(−7°C) or lower.

To use the engine block heater
1. Turn the engine off.
2. Open the hood and unwrap the engine

block heater cord.

3. Plug the engine block heater cord into a
grounded 3-wire, 3-pronged extension
cord.

4. Plug the extension cord into a Ground
( G F I ) p r o t e c t e d ,

F a u l t
grounded 110-volt AC (VAC) outlet.

I n t e r r u p t

5. The engine block heater must be plugged
in for at least 2 - 4 hours, depending on
outside temperatures, to properly warm
the engine coolant. Use an appropriate
timer to turn the engine block heater on.
6. Before starting the engine, unplug and
properly store the cord to keep it away
from moving parts.

WARNING

. Do not use your engine block heater
with an ungrounded electrical system
or a 2-pronged adapter. You can be
seriously injured by an electrical
shock if you use an ungrounded
connection.

. Disconnect and properly store the
engine block heater cord before

starting the engine. Damage to the
cord could result in an electrical shock
and can cause serious injury.

. Use a heavy-duty 3-wire, 3-pronged
extension cord rated for at least 10A.
Plug the extension cord into a Ground
Fault Interrupt (GFI) protected,
grounded 110-VAC outlet. Failure
to use the proper extension cord or
a grounded outlet can result in a fire
or electrical shock and cause serious
personal injury.

HAZARD WARNING FLASHER SWITCH

ROADSIDE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM

. Turn signals do not work when the
hazard warning flasher lights are on.

The flasher can be actuated with the ignition
switch in any position.
When an impact that could activate the
supplemental air bags is detected, the
hazard warning flasher lights blink automa-
tically. If the hazard warning flasher switch is
pushed twice, the hazard warning flashers
will turn off.

In the event of a roadside emergency,
Roadside Assistance Service is available to
you. Please refer to your Warranty Informa-
tion Booklet (U.S.) or Warranty & Roadside
Assistance Information Booklet (Canada) for
details.

SIC2574

WARNING

Push the switch on to warn other drivers
when you must stop or park under emer-
gency conditions. All turn signal lights will
flash.

Do not turn the hazard warning flasher
switch to off until you can make sure
that it is safe to do so. Also, the hazard
flasher warning may not blink automa-
tically depending on the force of impact.

Some state laws may prohibit the use of the
hazard warning flasher switch while driving.

WARNING

.

If stopping for an emergency, be sure
to move the vehicle well off the road.
. Do not use the hazard warning
flashers while moving on the highway
unless unusual circumstances force
you to drive so slowly that your
vehicle might become a hazard to
other traffic.

EMERGENCY ENGINE SHUT OFF

FLAT TIRE

To shut off the engine in an emergency
situation while driving, perform the follow-
ing procedure:
. Rapidly push the push-button ignition
switch 3 consecutive times in less than
1.5 seconds, or

. Push and hold the push-button ignition

switch for more than 2 seconds.

TIRE PRESSURE MONITORING
SYSTEM (TPMS)
This vehicle is equipped with the Tire
Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS).
It
monitors tire pressure of all tires except the
spare. When the low tire pressure warning
light is lit and the CHECK TIRE PRESSURE
warning appears in the vehicle information
display, one or more of your tires is sig-
nificantly under-inflated.
If the vehicle is
being driven with low tire pressure, the
TPMS will activate and warn you of it by
the low tire pressure warning light. This
system will activate only when the vehicle is
driven at speeds above 16 MPH (25 km/h).
For more details, see “Warning lights,
in-
dicator lights and audible reminders” (P.2-
11) and “Tire Pressure Monitoring System
(TPMS)” (P.5-5).

WARNING

.

If the low tire pressure warning light
illuminates or Low Pressure informa-
tion is displayed on the monitor
screen while driving, avoid sudden
steering maneuvers or abrupt brak-
ing, reduce vehicle speed, pull off the
road to a safe location and stop the
vehicle as soon as possible. Driving

with under-inflated tires may perma-
nently damage the tires and increase
the likelihood of tire failure. Serious
vehicle damage could occur and may
lead to an accident and could result in
serious personal injury. Check the tire
pressure for all four tires. Adjust the
tire pressure to the recommended
COLD tire pressure shown on the
Tire and Loading Information label to
turn the low tire pressure warning
light OFF. If the light still illuminates
while driving after adjusting the tire
pressure, a tire may be flat. If you
have a flat tire, replace it with a spare
tire as soon as possible.

. Since the spare tire is not equipped
with the TPMS, when a spare tire is
mounted or a wheel is replaced, the
TPMS will not function and the low
tire pressure warning light will flash
for approximately 1 minute. The light
will remain on after 1 minute. Have
your tires replaced and/or TPMS
system reset as soon as possible. It
is recommended you visit an INFINITI
retailer for these services.

. Replacing tires with those not origin-
ally specified by INFINITI could affect
the proper operation of the TPMS.

tion.

. Never change tires when the vehicle
is on a slope, ice or slippery areas.
This is hazardous.

. Never change tires if oncoming traf-
fic is close to your vehicle. Wait for
professional road assistance.

. Do not inject any tire liquid or aerosol
tire sealant into the tires, as this may
cause a malfunction of the tire pres-
sure sensors.

COLD pressure:
After the vehicle has been parked for
three hours or more or driven less
than 1 mile (1.6 km).
COLD tire pressures are shown on
the Tire and Loading Information
label affixed to the driver side center
pillar.

After adjusting tire pressure to the COLD
tire pressure, the display of the tire pressure
information may show higher pressure than
the COLD tire pressure after the vehicle has
been driven more than 1 mile (1.6 km). This is
because the tire pressurizes as the tire
temperature rises. This does not indicate a
system malfunction.

Stowing the damaged tire and tools
1. Securely store the damaged tire, jack and

tools in the storage area.

2. Close the cargo floor cover.
3. Replace the cargo floor board.
4. Close the liftgate.

CAUTION

. Do not continue to drive if your
vehicle overheats. Doing so could
cause engine damage or a vehicle fire.
. To avoid the danger of being scalded,
never remove the radiator cap or
coolant reservoir cap while the en-
gine is still hot. When the radiator
cap or coolant reservoir cap is re-
moved, pressurized hot water will
spurt out, possibly causing serious
injury.

. Do not open the hood if steam is

coming out.

If your vehicle is overheating (indicated by an
extremely high temperature gauge reading),
or if you feel a lack of engine power, detect
abnormal noise, etc., take the following

If engine overheating is caused by climb-
ing a long hill on a hot day, run the engine
at a fast idle (approximately 1,500 rpm)
until the temperature gauge indication
returns to normal.

4. Get out of the vehicle. Look and listen for
steam or coolant escaping from the
radiator before opening the hood.
(If
steam or coolant is escaping, turn off the
engine.) Do not open the hood further
until no steam or coolant can be seen.

5. Open the engine hood.

WARNING

If steam or water is coming from the
engine, stand clear to prevent getting
burned.

6. Visually check drive belts for damage or
looseness. Also check if the cooling fan is
running. The radiator hoses and radiator
should not leak water.
If coolant is
leaking or the cooling fan does not run,
stop the engine.

. Always attach safety chains before

towing.

VEHICLE RECOVERY (freeing a
stuck vehicle)

WARNING

. Stand clear of a stuck vehicle.
. Do not spin your tires at high speed.
This could cause them to explode and
result in serious injury. Parts of your
vehicle could also overheat and be
damaged.

Pulling a stuck vehicle
If your vehicle is stuck in sand, snow, mud,
etc., use a tow strap or other device
designed specifically for vehicle recovery.
Always follow the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions for the recovery device.
Attach the tow strap to the towing hook.

CAUTION

. Tow chains or cables must be at-
tached only to the main structural
members of the vehicle or the towing
hooks. Otherwise, the vehicle body
will be damaged.

. Use the towing hook only to free a
vehicle stuck in sand, snow, mud, etc.
Never tow the vehicle for a long
distance using only the towing hook.
. The towing hook is under tremendous
force when used to free a stuck
vehicle. Never pull the hook at an
angle.

. Always pull the cable straight out
from the front or rear of the vehicle.
. Pulling devices should be routed so
they do not touch any part of the
suspension, steering, brake or cooling
systems.

. Pulling devices such as ropes or

CLEANING EXTERIOR

In order to maintain the appearance of your
vehicle, it is important to take proper care of
it.
To protect the paint surface, wash your
vehicle as soon as you can:
. after a rainfall to prevent possible da-

mage from acid rain

. after driving on coastal roads
. when contaminants such as soot, bird
droppings, tree sap, metal particles or
bugs get on the paint surface

. when dust or mud builds up on the

surface

Whenever possible, store or park your
vehicle inside a garage or in a covered area.
When it is necessary to park outside, park in
a shady area or protect the vehicle with a
body cover.
Be careful not to scratch the paint surface
when putting on or removing the body
cover.

7-2 Appearance and care

WASHING
Wash dirt off the vehicle with a wet sponge
and plenty of water. Clean the vehicle
thoroughly using a mild soap, a special
vehicle soap or general purpose dishwashing
liquid mixed with clean, lukewarm (never hot)
water.

on dirt or other foreign substances so
the paint surface is not scratched or
damaged.

. Lock all doors before going through
automatic car wash. Locking doors
helps prevent fuel-filler door from
opening and becoming damaged.

CAUTION

. Do not use car washes that use acid in
the detergent. Some car washes,
especially brushless ones, use some
acid for cleaning. The acid may react
with some plastic vehicle compo-
nents, causing them to crack. This
could affect their appearance, and
also could cause them not to function
properly. Always check with your car
wash to confirm that acid is not used.
. Do not wash the vehicle with strong
household soap, strong chemical de-
tergents, gasoline or solvents.

. Do not wash the vehicle in direct
sunlight or while the vehicle body is
hot, as the surface may become
water-spotted.

. Avoid using tight-napped or rough
cloths, such as washing mitts. Care
must be taken when removing caked-

Rinse the vehicle again with plenty of clean
water.
Inside flanges, seams and folds on the doors,
hatches and hood are particularly vulnerable
to the effects of road salt. Therefore, these
areas must be regularly cleaned. Make sure
that the drain holes in the lower edge of the
door are open. Spray water under the body
and in the wheel wells to loosen the dirt and
wash away road salt.
Avoid leaving water spots on the paint
surface by using a damp chamois to dry the
vehicle.
For LIMITED models, be sure to wash dirt
off the cylindrical part or lens of the side step
light with a high-pressure washing machine.
Otherwise, the brightness of the lights may
decrease due to the adhesion of dirt.

WAXING
Regular waxing protects the paint surface
and helps retain new vehicle appearance.
Polishing is recommended to remove built-
up wax residue and to avoid a weathered
appearance before reapplying wax.
An INFINITI retailer can assist you in choos-
ing the proper product.
. Wax your vehicle only after a thorough
washing. Follow the instructions sup-
plied with the wax.

. Do not use a wax containing any abra-
sives, cutting compounds or cleaners
that may damage the vehicle finish.

Machine compound or aggressive polishing
on a base coat/clear coat paint finish may
dull the finish or leave swirl marks.

REMOVING SPOTS
Remove tar and oil spots,
industrial dust,
insects, and tree sap as quickly as possible
from the paint surface to avoid lasting
damage or staining. Special cleaning pro-
ducts are available at an INFINITI retailer or
any automotive accessory stores.

UNDERBODY
In areas where road salt is used in winter, the
underbody must be cleaned regularly. This
will prevent dirt and salt from building up
and causing the acceleration of corrosion on
the underbody and suspension. Before the
winter period and again in the spring, the
underseal must be checked and, if necessary,
re-treated.

GLASS
Use glass cleaner to remove smoke and dust
film from the glass surfaces. It is normal for
glass to become coated with a film after the
vehicle is parked in the hot sun. Glass cleaner
and a soft cloth will easily remove this film.

WHEELS
Wash the wheels when washing the vehicle
to maintain their appearance.
. Clean the inner side of the wheels when
the wheel is changed or the underside of
the vehicle is washed.
Inspect wheel rims regularly for dents or
corrosion. Such damage may cause loss
of pressure or poor seal at the tire bead.
INFINITI recommends that the road
wheels be waxed to protect against road
salt in areas where it is used during
winter.

.

.

CAUTION

CAUTION

Do not use abrasive cleaners when
washing the wheels.

When cleaning the inside of the win-
dows, do not use sharp-edged tools,
abrasive cleaners or chlorine-based dis-
infectant cleaners. They could damage
the electrical conductors, radio antenna
elements or rear window defroster ele-
ments.

Aluminum alloy wheels
Wash regularly with a sponge dampened in a
mild soap solution, especially during winter
months in areas where road salt is used. Salt
could discolor the wheels if not removed.

Appearance and care 7-3

form a compound. This compound may come
off the tire while driving and stain the vehicle
paint.
If you choose to use a tire dressing, take the
following precautions:
. Use a water-based tire dressing. The
coating on the tire dissolves more easily
with an oil-based tire dressing.

. Apply a light coat of tire dressing to help
prevent it from entering the tire tread/
grooves (where it would be difficult to
remove).

. Wipe off excess tire dressing using a dry
towel. Make sure the tire dressing is
completely removed from the tire tread/
grooves.

. Allow the tire dressing to dry as recom-

mended by tire dressing manufacturer.

CAUTION

CAUTION

Follow the directions below to avoid
staining or discoloring the wheels:
. Do not use a cleaner that uses strong
acid or alkali contents to clean the
wheels.

. Do not apply wheel cleaners to the
wheels when they are hot. The wheel
temperature should be the same as
ambient temperature.

. Rinse the wheel to completely re-
move the cleaner within 15 minutes
after the cleaner is applied.

Bright wheels (if so equipped)
The bright wheels use a different coating
process than typical aluminum alloy wheel
and they are not plated wheels. These
wheels are clear-coated and require the
following special cleaning. They should be
regularly washed with a soft sponge soaked
in a lot of water. After washing with water,
wipe clean with a dry, soft cloth and dry
completely. When there is chemical or tire
wax, or dirt such as an antifreeze agent on
the surface, wash them with water as soon
as possible.

7-4 Appearance and care

. The surfaces of the wheels use a
different coating process than typical
aluminum alloy wheels. Do not use
aluminum alloy wheel cleaners or
abrasive cleaners to clean the wheels.
Using such cleaners could damage the
wheel surfaces.

. Do not use an automatic car wash if
the vehicle is equipped with bright
wheels. The wheel coating may be
damaged.

. Do not use a brush to wash the
wheels if the vehicle is equipped with
bright wheels. The wheel coating may
be damaged.

CHROME PARTS
Clean chrome parts regularly with a non-
abrasive chrome polish to maintain the
finish.

TIRE DRESSING
INFINITI does not recommend the use of tire
dressings. Tire manufacturers apply a coat-
ing to the tires to help reduce discoloration
of the rubber. If a tire dressing is applied to
the tires, it may react with the coating and

CLEANING INTERIOR

Occasionally remove loose dust from the
interior trim, plastic parts and seats using a
vacuum cleaner or soft bristled brush. Wipe
the vinyl and leather surfaces with a clean,
soft cloth dampened in mild soap solution,
then wipe clean with a dry soft cloth.
Regular care and cleaning is required in order
to maintain the appearance of the leather.
Before using any fabric protector, read the
manufacturer’s recommendations. Some
fabric protectors contain chemicals that
may stain or bleach the seat material.
Use a cloth dampened only with water, to
clean the meter and gauge lens.

WARNING

Do not use water or acidic cleaners (hot
steam cleaners) on the seat. This can
damage the seat or occupant classifica-
tion sensors. This can also affect the
operation of the air bag system and
result in serious personal injury.

CAUTION

. Never use benzine, thinner, or any

similar material.

. For cleaning, use a soft cloth, dam-
pened with water. Never use a rough
cloth, alcohol, benzine, thinner or any
kind of solvent or paper towel with a
chemical cleaning agent. They will
scratch or cause discoloration to the
lens.

. Do not spray any liquid such as water
on the meter lens. Spraying liquid
may cause the system to malfunction.
. Small dirt particles can be abrasive
and damaging to the leather surfaces
and should be removed promptly. Do
not use saddle soap, car waxes,
polishes, oils, cleaning fluids, sol-
vents, detergents or ammonia-based
cleaners as they may damage the
leather’s natural finish.

. Only use fabric protectors approved

by INFINITI.

. Do not use glass or plastic cleaner on
meter or gauge lens covers. It may
damage the lens cover.

AIR FRESHENERS
Most air fresheners use a solvent that could
affect the vehicle interior. If you use an air
freshener, take the following precautions:
. Hanging-type air fresheners can cause
permanent discoloration when they con-
tact vehicle interior surfaces. Place the
air freshener in a location that allows it
to hang free and not contact an interior
surface.

. Liquid-type air fresheners typically clip
on the vents. These products can cause
immediate damage and discoloration
when spilled on interior surfaces.

Carefully read and follow the manufac-
turer’s instructions before using air fresh-
eners.

. Periodically check the floor mats to
make sure they are properly installed.
. After cleaning the vehicle interior,
check the floor mats to make sure
they are properly installed.

The use of genuine INFINITI floor mats can
extend the life of your vehicle carpet and
make it easier to clean the interior. Mats
should be maintained with regular cleaning
and replaced if they become excessively
worn.

. Do not rub the material with a cloth.
Doing so can damage the surface of
the material or cause a stain to
spread.

. Never use benzine, thinner or any
similar chemical to clean the suede.
This may discolor the material and
damage the surface.

. Clean water or oil based stains by
patting the surface with a clean soft
cloth dampened in warm water. Press
a clean dry cloth onto the surface to
remove as much dampness as possi-
ble and then let air dry.

OPEN PORE MATTE FINISH
WOOD TRIM (LIMITED models)
The wood trim on the LIMITED models uses
a different coating process than a typical
wood trim.
Improper care can affect the
appearance of the wood trim and cause
damage to it.

CAUTION

. Do not hit the wood trim with a hard

or sharp object.

. Do not rub the wood trim surface

hard.

CORROSION PROTECTION

MOST COMMON FACTORS
CONTRIBUTING TO VEHICLE
CORROSION
. The accumulation of moisture-retaining
dirt and debris in body panel sections,
cavities, and other areas.

. Damage to paint and other protective
coatings caused by gravel and stone
chips or minor traffic accidents.

ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS IN-
FLUENCE THE RATE OF COR-
ROSION

Moisture
Accumulation of sand, dirt and water on the
vehicle body underside can accelerate corro-
sion. Wet floor coverings will not dry
completely inside the vehicle, and should be
removed for drying to avoid floor panel
corrosion.

Relative humidity
Corrosion will be accelerated in areas of high
relative humidity, especially those areas
where the temperatures stay above freezing
where atmospheric pollution exists, or where
road salt is used.

Temperature
A temperature increase will accelerate the
rate of corrosion to those parts which are
not well ventilated.

Air pollution
Industrial pollution, the presence of salt in
the air in coastal areas, or heavy road salt
use will accelerate the corrosion process.
Road salt will also accelerate the disintegra-
tion of paint surfaces.

TO PROTECT YOUR VEHICLE
FROM CORROSION
. Wash and wax your vehicle often to keep

the vehicle clean.

. Always check for minor damage to the

paint and repair it as soon as possible.

. Keep drain holes at the bottom of the
doors open to avoid water accumulation.
. Check the underbody for accumulation of
sand, dirt or salt. If present, wash with
water as soon as possible.

CAUTION

. NEVER remove dirt, sand or other
debris from the passenger compart-
ment by washing it out with a hose.
Remove dirt with a vacuum cleaner.

. Never allow water or other liquids to
come in contact with electronic com-
ponents inside the vehicle as this may
damage them.

Chemicals used for road surface deicing are
extremely corrosive. They accelerate corro-
sion and deterioration of underbody compo-
nents such as the exhaust system, fuel and
brake lines, brake cables, floor pan and
fenders.
In winter, the underbody must be cleaned
periodically.
For additional protection against rust and
corrosion, which may be required in some
areas,
it is recommended you consult an
INFINITI retailer.

MAINTENANCE PRECAUTIONS

When performing any inspection or main-
tenance work on your vehicle, always take
care to prevent serious accidental injury to
yourself or damage to the vehicle. The
following are general precautions which
should be closely observed.

WARNING

. Park the vehicle on a level surface,
apply the parking brake securely and
block the wheels to prevent the
vehicle from moving. Move the shift
lever to P (Park).

. Be sure the ignition switch is in the
OFF or LOCK position when per-
forming any parts replacement or
repairs.

. Never connect or disconnect the
battery or any transistorized compo-
nent while the ignition switch is in the
ON position.

. Never leave the engine or automatic
transmission related component har-
nesses disconnected while the igni-
tion switch is in the ON position.
If you must work with the engine
running, keep your hands, clothing,
hair and tools away from moving
fans, belts and any other moving

parts.
It is advisable to secure or remove
any loose clothing and remove any
jewelry, such as rings, watches, etc.
before working on your vehicle.

. Always wear eye protection when-

ever you work on your vehicle.
If you must run the engine in an
enclosed space such as a garage, be
sure there is proper ventilation for
exhaust gases to escape.

. Never get under the vehicle while it is
supported only by a jack.
If it is
necessary to work under the vehicle,
support it with safety stands.

. Keep smoking materials, flame and
sparks away from fuel tank and the
battery.

. Your vehicle is equipped with an
automatic engine cooling fan. It may
come on at any time without warn-
ing, even if the ignition key is in the
OFF position and the engine is not
running. To avoid injury, always dis-
connect the negative battery cable
before working near the fan.

. On gasoline engine models, the fuel
filter or fuel lines should be serviced
because the fuel lines are under high
pressure even when the engine is off.

It is recommended you visit an
INFINITI retailer for this service.

CAUTION

. Do not work under the hood while the
engine is hot. Turn the engine off and
wait until it cools down.

. Avoid direct contact with used en-
gine oil and coolant. Improperly dis-
posed engine oil, coolant, and/or
other vehicle fluids can damage the
environment. Always conform to lo-
cal regulations for disposal of vehicle
fluid.

BRAKES

It is recommended you visit an INFINITI
retailer if checking or replacement is re-
quired.

If the brakes do not operate properly, have
the brakes checked. It is recommended that
you visit an INFINITI retailer for this service.

SELF-ADJUSTING BRAKES
Your vehicle is equipped with self-adjusting
brakes.
The disc-type brakes self-adjust every time
the brake pedal is applied.

WARNING

Have your brake system checked if the
brake pedal height does not return to
normal. It is recommended you visit an
INFINITI retailer for this service.

BRAKE PAD WEAR WARNING
The disc brake pads have audible wear
warnings. When a brake pad requires repla-
cement, it will make a high pitched scraping
sound when the vehicle is in motion. This
scraping sound will first occur only when the
brake pedal is depressed. After more wear of
the brake pad, the sound will always be
heard even if the brake pedal
is not
depressed. Have the brakes checked as soon
as possible if the wear warning sound is
heard.
Under some driving or climate conditions,

occasional brake squeak, squeal or other
noise may be heard. Occasional brake noise
during light to moderate stops is normal and
does not affect the function or performance
of the brake system.
Proper brake inspection intervals should be
followed. For additional information, see the
maintenance schedules shown in the “9.
Maintenance and schedules” section.

BRAKE BOOSTER
Check the brake booster function as follows:
1. With the engine off, depress and release
the foot brake pedal more than 20 times.
When the foot brake pedal movement
(distance of travel) remains the same
from one pedal application to the next,
continue on to the next step.

2. While depressing the foot brake pedal,

start the engine.

3. With the foot brake pedal depressed,
stop the engine. Keep the pedal de-
pressed for about 30 seconds.

4. Run the engine for 1 minute without
depressing the foot brake pedal, then
turn it off. Depress the foot brake pedal
several times. The pedal travel distance
will decrease gradually with each de-
pression as the hydraulic pressure de-
creases.

WHEELS AND TIRES

If you have a flat tire, see “Flat tire” (P.6-3).

TIRE PRESSURE

Tire Pressure Monitoring System
(TPMS)
This vehicle is equipped with the Tire
Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS).
It
monitors tire pressure of all tires except the
spare. When the low tire pressure warning
light is lit and the CHECK TIRE PRESSURE
warning appears in the vehicle information
display, one or more of your tires is sig-
nificantly under-inflated.
The TPMS will activate only when the
vehicle is driven at speeds above 16 MPH
(25 km/h). Also, this system may not detect
a sudden drop in tire pressure (for example, a
flat tire while driving).
For more details, see “Low tire pressure
warning light” (P.2-15), “Tire Pressure Mon-
itoring System (TPMS)” (P.5-5) and “Tire
Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) ” (P.6-
3).

Tire inflation pressure
Check the pressure of the tires (in-
cluding the spare) often and always
prior to long distance trips. The
recommended tire pressure specifica-
tions are shown on the Tire and

Loading Information label under the
“Cold Tire Pressure” heading. The Tire
and Loading Information label
is
affixed to the driver side center pillar.
Tire pressures should be checked
regularly because:
. Most tires naturally lose air over

time.

. Tires can lose air suddenly when
driven over potholes or other ob-
jects or if the vehicle strikes a curb
while parking.

The tire pressures should be checked
when the tires are cold. The tires are
considered COLD after the vehicle
has been parked for 3 or more hours,
or driven less than 1 mile (1.6 km) at
moderate speeds.
TPMS with Tire Inflation Indicator
provides visual and audible signals
outside the vehicle for inflating the
tires to the recommended COLD tire
pressure. (See “TPMS with Tire Infla-
tion Indicator” (P.5-7) about the
TPMS with Tire Inflation Indicator.)

Do not load your vehicle beyond
this capacity. Overloading your
vehicle may result in reduced
tire life, unsafe operating con-
ditions due to premature tire
failure, or unfavorable handling
characteristics and could also
lead to a serious accident.
Loading beyond the specified

TIRE LABELING
Federal
law requires tire manufac-
turers to place standardized informa-
tion on the sidewall of all tires. This
information identifies and describes
the fundamental characteristics of
the tire and also provides the tire
identification number (TIN) for safety
standard certification. The TIN can be
used to identify the tire in case of a
recall.

Tire size (example: P215/60R16
94H)

1. P: The “P” indicates the tire is
designed for passenger vehicles.
(Not all tires have this informa-
tion.)

2. Three-digit number (215): This
number gives the width in milli-
meters of the tire from sidewall
edge to sidewall edge.

3. Two-digit number (60): This num-
ber, known as the aspect ratio,
gives the tire’s ratio of height to

width.

4. R: The “R” stands for radial.
5. Two-digit number (16): This num-
ber is the wheel or rim diameter in
inches.

6. Two- or three-digit number (94):
This number is the tire’s load index.
It is a measurement of how much
weight each tire can support. You
may not find this information on all
tires because it is not required by
law.

7. H: Tire speed rating. You should
not drive the vehicle faster than
the tire speed rating.

Do-it-yourself 8-31

5. Four numbers represent the week
and year the tire was built. For
example, the numbers 3103
means the 31st week of 2003. If
these numbers are missing, then
look on the other sidewall of the
tire.

Tire ply composition and material
The number of layers or plies of
rubber-coated fabric in the tire.
Tire manufacturers also must in-
dicate the materials in the tire,
which include steel, nylon, polye-
ster, and others.
Maximum permissible inflation
pressure
This number is the greatest
amount of air pressure that
should be put in the tire. Do not
exceed the maximum permissible
inflation pressure.
Maximum load rating
This number indicates the max-
imum load in kilograms and
pounds that can be carried by
the tire. When replacing the tires
on the vehicle, always use a tire

that has the same load rating as
the factory installed tire.
Term of “tubeless” or “tube type”
Indicates whether the tire re-
quires an inner tube (“tube type”)
or not (“tubeless”).
The word “radial”
The word “radial” is shown, if the
tire has radial structure.
Manufacturer or brand name
Manufacturer or brand name is
shown.

Other tire-related terminology:
In addition to the many terms that are
defined throughout this section, In-
tended Outboard Sidewall is (1) the
sidewall that contains a whitewall,
bears white lettering or bears manu-
facturer, brand and/or model name
molding that is higher or deeper than
the same molding on the other side-
wall of the tire, or (2) the outward
facing sidewall of an asymmetrical
tire that has a particular side that
must always face outward when
mounted on a vehicle.

TYPES OF TIRES

WARNING

. When changing or replacing tires, be
sure all four tires are of the same type
(Example: Summer, All Season or
Snow) and construction. An INFINITI
retailer may be able to help you with
information about tire type, size,
speed rating and availability.

. Replacement tires may have a lower
speed rating than the factory
equipped tires, and may not match
the potential maximum vehicle speed.
Never exceed the maximum speed
rating of the tire.

. Replacing tires with those not origin-
ally specified by INFINITI could affect
the proper operation of the TPMS.

. For additional information regarding
tires, refer to “Important Tire Safety
Information” (US) or “Tire Safety
Information” (Canada) in the War-
ranty Information Booklet.

All season tires
INFINITI specifies all season tires on some
models to provide good performance all

year, including snowy and icy road condi-
tions. All Season tires are identified by ALL
SEASON and/or M&S (Mud and Snow) on
the tire sidewall. Snow tires have better
snow traction than All Season tires and may
be more appropriate in some areas.

Summer tires
INFINITI specifies summer tires on some
models to provide superior performance on
dry roads. Summer tire performance is
substantially reduced in snow and ice. Sum-
mer tires do not have the tire traction rating
M&S on the tire sidewall.
If you plan to operate your vehicle in snowy
or icy conditions, INFINITI recommends the
use of SNOW tires or ALL SEASON tires on
all four wheels.

Snow tires
If snow tires are needed, it is necessary to
select tires equivalent in size and load rating
to the original equipment tires. If you do not,
it can adversely affect the safety and
handling of your vehicle.
Generally, snow tires will have lower speed
ratings than factory equipped tires and may
not match the potential maximum vehicle
speed. Never exceed the maximum speed
rating of the tire.
If you install snow tires, they must be the

same size, brand, construction and tread
pattern on all four wheels.
For additional traction on icy roads, studded
tires may be used. However, some U.S.
states and Canadian provinces prohibit their
use. Check local, state and provincial laws
before installing studded tires. Skid and
traction capabilities of studded snow tires,
on wet or dry surfaces, may be poorer than
that of non-studded snow tires.

TIRE CHAINS
Use of tire chains may be prohibited accord-
ing to location. Check the local laws before
installing tire chains. When installing tire
chains, make sure they are the proper size
for the tires on your vehicle and are installed
according to the chain manufacturer’s sug-
gestions. Use only SAE Class S chains. Class
“S” chains are used on vehicles with re-
stricted tire to vehicle clearance. Vehicles
that can use Class “S” chains are designed to
meet the SAE standard minimum clearances
between the tire and the closest vehicle
suspension or body component required to
accommodate the use of a winter traction
device (tire chains or cables). The minimum
clearances are determined using the factory
equipped tire size. Other types may damage
your vehicle. Use chain tensioners when
recommended by the tire chain manufac-
turer to ensure a tight fit. Loose end links of

Do-it-yourself 8-33

the tire chain must be secured or removed to
prevent the possibility of whipping action
damage to the fenders or underbody.
If
possible, avoid fully loading your vehicle
when using tire chains. In addition, drive at
a reduced speed. Otherwise, your vehicle
may be damaged and/or vehicle handling
and performance may be adversely affected.
Tire chains must be installed only on the
rear wheels and not on the front wheels.
Never install tire chains on the full-size
temporary use only spare tire (if so
equipped).
Do not use tire chains on dry roads. Driving
with tire chains in such conditions can cause
damage to the various mechanisms of the
vehicle due to some overstress.

8-34 Do-it-yourself

The wheel nuts must be kept tigh-
tened to the specification at all times.
It is recommended that wheel nuts be
tightened to the specification at each
tire rotation interval.

WARNING

. After rotating the tires, check

and adjust the tire pressure.

. Retighten the wheel nuts when
the vehicle has been driven for
600 miles (1,000 km) (also in
cases of a flat tire, etc.).

. Do not include the full-size
temporary use only spare tire
(if so equipped)
in the tire

CHANGING WHEELS AND TIRES

Tire rotation
INFINITI recommends rotating the
tires every 5,000 miles (8,000 km).
(See “Flat tire” (P.6-3) for tire repla-
cing procedures.)
As soon as possible, tighten the
wheel nuts to the specified torque
with a torque wrench.

Wheel nut tightening torque:

98 ft-lb (133 N·m)

tread wear indicators. When
wear indicators are visible, the
tire(s) should be replaced.

. Tires degrade with age and use.
Have tires, including the spare,
over 6 years old checked by a
qualified technician, because
some tire damage may not be
obvious. Replace the tires as
necessary to prevent tire failure
and possible personal injury.

. Improper service of the spare
tire may result in serious perso-
nal injury. If it is necessary to
repair the spare tire, it is re-
c o m m e n d e d y o u v i s i t a n
INFINITI retailer for this ser-
vice.

. For additional information re-
garding tires, refer to “Impor-
tant Tire Safety Information”
(US) or “Tire Safety Informa-
tion” (Canada) in the Warranty
Information Booklet.

Replacing wheels and tires
When replacing a tire, use the same size,
tread design, speed rating and load carrying
capacity as originally equipped. (See “Speci-
fications” (P.10-8) for recommended types
and sizes of tires and wheels.)

WARNING

. The use of tires other than those
recommended or the mixed use of
tires of different brands, construc-
tion (bias, bias-belted or radial), or
tread patterns can adversely affect
the ride, braking, handling, ground
clearance, body-to-tire clearance,
tire chain clearance, speedometer
calibration, headlight aim and bum-
per height. Some of these effects may
lead to accidents and could result in
serious personal injury.

. For Two-Wheel Drive (2WD) models,
if your vehicle was originally
equipped with 4 tires that were the
same size and you are only replacing
2 of the 4 tires, install the new tires
on the rear axle. Placing new tires on
the front axle may cause loss of
vehicle control in some driving condi-
tions and cause an accident and
personal injury.

Tire wear and damage

WARNING

. Tires should be periodically in-
spected for wear, cracking, bul-
ging or objects caught in the
tread. If excessive wear, cracks,
bulging or deep cuts are found,
the tire(s) should be replaced.

. The original tires have built-in

.

If the wheels are changed for any
reason, always replace with wheels
which have the same off-set dimen-
sion. Wheels of a different off-set
could cause premature tire wear,
degrade vehicle handling character-
istics and/or interference with the
brake discs/drums. Such interference
can lead to decreased braking effi-
ciency and/or early brake pad/shoe
wear. See “Wheels and tires” (P.10-
9) for wheel off-set dimensions.

. Since the spare tire is not equipped
with the TPMS, when a spare tire is
mounted or a wheel is replaced, the
TPMS will not function and the low
tire pressure warning light will flash
for approximately 1 minute. The light
will remain on after 1 minute. Have
your tires replaced and/or TPMS
system reset as soon as possible. It
is recommended you visit an INFINITI
retailer for these services.

. Replacing tires with those not origin-
ally specified by INFINITI could affect
the proper operation of the TPMS.

. The TPMS sensor may be damaged if
it is not handled correctly. Be careful
when handling the TPMS sensor.

. When replacing the TPMS sensor, the
ID registration may be required. It is

8-36 Do-it-yourself

recommended you visit an INFINITI
retailer for ID registration.

. Do not use a valve stem cap that is
not specified by INFINITI. The valve
stem cap may become stuck.

. Be sure that the valve stem caps are
correctly fitted. Otherwise the valve
may be clogged up with dirt and
cause a malfunction or loss of pres-
sure.

. Do not install a damaged or deformed
wheel or tire even if it has been
repaired. Such wheels or tires could
have structural damage and could fail
without warning.

. The use of retread tire is not recom-

mended.

. For additional information regarding
tires, refer to “Important Tire Safety
Information” (US) or “Tire Safety
Information” (Canada) in the War-
ranty Information Booklet.

Four-Wheel Drive (4WD) models

CAUTION

. Always use tires of the same type,
size, brand, construction (bias, bias-
belted or radial), and tread pattern
on all four wheels. Failure to do so
may result in a circumference differ-
ence between tires on the front and
rear axles which will cause excessive
tire wear and may damage the trans-
mission, transfer case and differential
gears.

. ONLY use spare tires specified for

the 4WD model.

If excessive tire wear is found, it is recom-
mended that all four tires be replaced with
tires of the same size, brand, construction
and tread pattern. The tire pressure and
wheel alignment should also be checked and
corrected as necessary. It is recommended
you visit an INFINITI retailer for this service.

Wheel balance
Unbalanced wheels may affect vehicle hand-
ling and tire life. Even with regular use,
wheels can get out of balance. Therefore,
they should be balanced as required.

Wheel balance service should be performed
with the wheels off the vehicle. Spin
balancing the wheels on the vehicle could
lead to mechanical damage.
For additional
information regarding tires,
refer to “Important Tire Safety Information”
(US) or “Tire Safety Information” (Canada) in
the INFINITI Warranty Information Booklet.

Care of wheels
See “Cleaning exterior” (P.7-2) for details
about care of the wheels.

Spare tire
Since the spare tire is not equipped with the
TPMS, when a spare tire is mounted (TEM-
PORARY USE ONLY or conventional), the
TPMS will not function.

Spare tire (FULL-SIZE TEMPORARY USE
ONLY spare tire) (Applies ONLY to vehicles
equipped with P275/50R22 tires):
Observe the following precautions if the full-
size temporary use only spare tire must be
used, otherwise your vehicle could be da-
maged or involved in an accident.

WARNING

. The full-size temporary use only
spare tire should be used for emer-

gency use. It should be replaced with
the standard tire at the first oppor-
tunity to avoid possible tire or differ-
ential damage

. Drive carefully while the spare tire is
installed. Avoid sharp turns and
abrupt braking while driving. The
vehicle driving performance may be
affected when driving on wet or
snow covered roads.

. When the spare tire is installed, the
following systems may not work
correctly.
— Tire Pressure Monitoring System

(TPMS)

System

— Vehicle Dynamic Control (VDC)

. Periodically check spare tire inflation
pressure. Always keep the spare tire
inflated to the pressure specification
shown on the Tire and Loading
Information label. For Tire and Load-
ing Information label
location, see
“Tire and Loading Information label”
in the index of this manual.

. With the spare tire installed do not
drive your vehicle at speeds faster
than 50 MPH (80 km/h).

. When driving on roads covered with
snow or ice, the spare tire should be

used on the front wheels and original
tire used on the rear wheels (drive
wheels). Use tire chains only on the
two rear original tires.

. Do not use the spare tire on other

vehicles.

. Do not use more than one spare tire

at the same time.

CAUTION

Do not use tire chains on the spare tire.
Tire chains will not fit properly and may
cause damage to the vehicle.

MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENT

GENERAL MAINTENANCE

Some day-to-day and regular maintenance
is essential to maintain your vehicle’s good
mechanical condition, as well as its emission
and engine performance.
It is the owner’s responsibility to make sure
that the scheduled maintenance, as well as
general maintenance, is performed.
As the vehicle owner, you are the only one
who can ensure that your vehicle receives
the proper maintenance. You are a vital link
in the maintenance chain.

GENERAL MAINTENANCE
General maintenance includes those items
which should be checked during normal day-
to-day operation. They are essential for
proper vehicle operation. It is your respon-
sibility to perform these procedures regularly
as prescribed.
Performing general maintenance checks re-
quires minimal mechanical skill and only a
few general automotive tools.
These checks or inspections can be done by
yourself, a qualified technician or,
if you
prefer, an INFINITI retailer.

SCHEDULED MAINTENANCE
The maintenance items listed in this section
are required to be serviced at regular inter-
vals. However, under severe driving condi-
t i o n s , a d d i t i o n a l o r m o r e f r e q u e n t
maintenance will be required.

WHERE TO GO FOR SERVICE
If maintenance service is required or your
vehicle appears to malfunction, have the
systems checked and serviced. It is recom-
mended you visit an INFINITI retailer for this
service.
INFINITI technicians are well-trained spe-
cialists and are kept up to date with the
latest service information through technical
bulletins, service tips, and training programs.
They are completely qualified to work on
INFINITI vehicles before work begins.
You can be confident that an INFINITI
retailer’s service department performs the
best job to meet the maintenance require-
ments on your vehicle.

During the normal day-to-day operation of
the vehicle, general maintenance should be
performed regularly as prescribed in this
section. If you detect any unusual sounds,
vibrations or smells, be sure to check for the
cause and have it checked promptly. It is
recommended to have an INFINITI retailer
do it promptly.
it is recom-
mended you visit an INFINITI retailer if you
think that repairs are required.
When performing any checks or mainte-
nance work, closely observe “Maintenance
precautions” (P.8-2).

In addition,

EXPLANATION OF MAINTE-
NANCE ITEMS

If necessary, adjust the pressure in all tires,
including the spare, to the pressure speci-
fied. Check carefully for damage, cuts or
excessive wear.
Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS)
transmitter components: Replace the TPMS
transmitter grommet seal, valve core and
cap when the tires are replaced due to wear
or age.
Wheel alignment and balance: If the vehicle
should pull to either side while driving on a
straight and level road, or if you detect
uneven or abnormal tire wear, there may be
a need for wheel alignment.

If the steering wheel or seat vibrates at
normal highway speeds, wheel balancing
may be needed.
For additional
information regarding tires,
refer to “Important Tire Safety Information”
(US) or “Tire Safety Information” (Canada) in

operation. If the brake pedal suddenly goes

down further than normal, the pedal feels
spongy or the vehicle seems to take longer to
stop, have your vehicle checked immediately.
It is recommended you visit an INFINITI
retailer for this service. Keep the floor mat
away from the pedal.
Brakes: Check that the brakes do not pull the
vehicle to one side when applied.
Parking brake: Check the parking brake
operation regularly. The vehicle should be
securely held on a fairly steep hill with only
the parking brake applied.
If the parking
brake needs adjusted, it is recommended you
visit an INFINITI retailer for this service.
Seat belts: Check that all parts of the seat
belt system (for example, buckles, anchors,
adjuster and retractors) operate properly
and smoothly, and are installed securely.
Check the belt webbing for cuts, fraying,
wear or damage.
Seats: Check seat position controls such as
seat adjusters, seatback recliner, etc. to
ensure they operate smoothly and that all
latches lock securely in every position. Check
that the head restraints/headrests move up
and down smoothly and that the locks (if so
equipped) hold securely in all latched posi-
tions.
Steering wheel: Check for changes in the
steering conditions, such as excessive free
play, hard steering or strange noises.

Maintenance and schedules 9-3

Warning lights and chimes: Make sure that
all warning lights and chimes are operating
properly.
Windshield defroster: Check that the air
comes out of the defroster outlets properly
and in sufficient quantity when operating
the heater or air conditioner.
Windshield wiper and washer*: Check that
the wipers and washer operate properly and
that the wipers do not streak.

Under the hood and vehicle
The maintenance items listed here should be
checked periodically (for example, each time
you check the engine oil or refuel).
Battery*: Check the fluid level in each cell. It
should be between the MAX and MIN lines.
Vehicles operated in high temperatures or
under severe condition require frequent
checks of the battery fluid level.

NOTE:
Care should be taken to avoid situations
that can lead to potential battery discharge
and potential no-start conditions such as:
1.

Installation or extended use of electro-
nic accessories that consume battery
power when the engine is not running
(Phone chargers, GPS, DVD players,
etc.)

9-4 Maintenance and schedules

2. Vehicle is not driven regularly and/or

only driven short distances.

In these cases, the battery may need to be
charged to maintain battery health.
Brake fluid level*: Make sure that the brake
fluid level is between the MAX and MIN lines
on the reservoir.
Engine coolant level*: Check the coolant
level when the engine is cold.
Engine drive belt*: Make sure that no belt is
frayed, worn, cracked or oily.
Engine oil
level*: Check the level after
parking the vehicle on a level spot and
turning off the engine. Wait more than 15
minutes for the oil to drain back into the oil
pan.
Exhaust system: Make sure there are no
loose supports, cracks or holes. If the sound
of the exhaust seems unusual or there is a
smell of exhaust fumes, immediately have
the exhaust system inspected. It is recom-
mended you visit an INFINITI retailer for this
service. (See “Precautions when starting and
driving” (P.5-4) for exhaust gas (carbon
monoxide).)
Fluid leaks: Check under the vehicle for fuel,
oil, water or other fluid leaks after the
vehicle has been parked for a while. Water
dripping from the air conditioner after use is
normal. If you should notice any leaks or if

gasoline fumes are evident, check for the
cause and have it corrected immediately.
Power steering fluid level* and lines: Check
the level when the fluid is cold, with the
engine off. Check the lines for proper
attachment, leaks, cracks, etc.
Radiator and hoses: Check the front of the
radiator and clean off any dirt,
insects,
leaves, etc., that may have accumulated.
Make sure the hoses have no cracks, defor-
mation, rot or loose connections.
Underbody: The underbody is frequently
exposed to corrosive substances such as
those used on icy roads or to control dust. It
is very important to remove these sub-
stances, otherwise rust will form on the
floor pan, frame, fuel lines and around the
exhaust system. At the end of winter, the
underbody should be thoroughly flushed
with plain water, being careful to clean
those areas where mud and dirt may accu-
mulate. For additional
information, see
“Cleaning exterior” (P.7-2).
Windshield washer fluid*: Check that there
is adequate fluid in the reservoir.

FUEL INFORMATION

VK56VD engine
INFINITI recommends the use of unleaded
premium gasoline with an octane rating of at
least 91 AKI
(Anti-Knock Index) number
(Research octane number 96).
If unleaded premium gasoline is not avail-
able, you may use unleaded regular gasoline
with an octane rating of at least 87 AKI
number (Research octane number 91), but
you may notice a decrease in performance.

CAUTION

. Using a fuel other than that specified
could adversely affect the emission
control system, and may also affect
warranty coverage.

. Under no circumstances should a
leaded gasoline be used, because this
will damage the three-way catalyst.
. Do not use E-15 or E-85 fuel in your
vehicle. Your vehicle is not designed
to run on E-15 or E-85 fuel. Using E-
15 or E-85 fuel
in a vehicle not
specifically designed for E-15 or E-
85 fuel can adversely affect the
emission control devices and systems
of the vehicle. Damage caused by

10-4 Technical and consumer information

such fuel
is not covered by the
INFINITI new vehicle limited war-
ranty.

. Do not use fuel that contains the
octane booster methylcyclopentadie-
nyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT).
Using fuel containing MMT may
adversely affect vehicle performance
and vehicle emissions. Not all fuel
dispensers are labeled to indicate
MMT content, so you may have to
consult your gasoline retailer for
more details. Note that Federal and
California laws prohibit the use of
MMT in reformulated gasoline.

. U.S. government regulations require
ethanol dispensing pumps to be iden-
tified by a small, square, orange and
black label with the common abbre-
viation or the appropriate percen-
tage for that region.

Gasoline specifications
INFINITI recommends using gasoline that
meets the World-Wide Fuel Charter
(WWFC) specifications where it is available.
Many of the automobile manufacturers
developed this specification to improve
emission system and vehicle performance.
Ask your service station manager if the
gasoline meets the World-Wide Fuel Char-

ter (WWFC) specifications.

Reformulated gasoline
Some fuel suppliers are now producing
reformulated gasolines. These gasolines are
specially designed to reduce vehicle emis-
sions.
INFINITI supports efforts towards
cleaner air and suggests that you use
reformulated gasoline when available.

Gasoline containing oxygenates
Some fuel suppliers sell gasoline containing
oxygenates such as ethanol, MTBE and
methanol with or without advertising their
presence. INFINITI does not recommend the
use of fuels of which the oxygenate content
and the fuel compatibility for your INFINITI
cannot be readily determined. If in doubt, ask
your service station manager.
If you use oxygenate-blend gasoline, please
take the following precautions as the usage
of such fuels may cause vehicle performance
problems and/or fuel system damage.
. The fuel should be unleaded and have an
octane rating no lower than that re-
commended for unleaded gasoline.
If an oxygenate-blend, excepting a
methanol blend, is used, it should con-
tain no more than 10% oxygenate.
(MTBE may, however, be added up to
15%.)

.

.

. E-15 fuel contains more than 10%
oxygenate. E-15 fuel will adversely
affect the emission control devices and
systems of the vehicle and should not be
used. Damage caused by such fuel is not
covered by the INFINITI new vehicle
limited warranty.
If a methanol blend is used, it should
contain no more than 5% methanol
(methyl alcohol, wood alcohol). It should
also contain a suitable amount of ap-
propriate cosolvents and corrosion in-
hibitors. If not properly formulated with
appropriate cosolvents and corrosion
inhibitors, such methanol blends may
cause fuel system damage and/or vehi-
cle performance problems. At this time,
sufficient data is not available to ensure
that all methanol blends are suitable for
use in INFINITI vehicles.

If any undesirable driveability problems such
as engine stalling or hard hot starting are
experienced after using oxygenate-blend
fuels, immediately change to a non-oxyge-
nate fuel or a fuel with a low blend of MTBE.
Take care not to spill gasoline during
refueling. Gasoline containing oxygenates
can cause paint damage.

E-15 fuel
E-15 fuel is a mixture of approximately 15%
fuel ethanol and 85% unleaded gasoline. E-
15 can only be used in vehicles designed to
run on E-15 fuel. Do not use E-15 in your
vehicle. U.S. government regulations require
fuel ethanol dispensing pumps to be identi-
fied with small, square, orange and black
label with the common abbreviation or the
appropriate percentage for that region.

E-85 fuel
E-85 fuel is a mixture of approximately 85%
fuel ethanol and 15% unleaded gasoline. E-
85 can only be used in a Flexible Fuel Vehicle
(FFV). Do not use E-85 fuel in your vehicle.
U.S. government regulations require fuel
ethanol dispensing pumps to be identified
by a small, square, orange and black label
with the common abbreviation or the appro-
priate percentage for that region.

Fuel containing MMT
MMT, or methylcyclopentadienyl manga-
nese tricarbonyl,
is an octane boosting
additive. INFINITI does not recommend the
use of fuel containing MMT. Such fuel may
adversely affect vehicle performance,
in-
cluding the emissions control system. Note
that while some fuel pumps label MMT
content, not all do, so you may have to

consult your gasoline retailer for more de-
tails.

Aftermarket fuel additives
INFINITI does not recommend the use of any
aftermarket fuel additives (Example: fuel
injector cleaner, octane booster, intake valve
deposit removers, etc.) which are sold com-
mercially. Many of these additives intended
for gum, varnish or deposit removal may
contain active solvent or similar ingredients
that can be harmful to the fuel system and
engine.

Octane rating tips
Using unleaded gasoline with an octane
rating lower than recommended above can
cause persistent, heavy spark knock. (Spark
knock is a metallic rapping noise.) If severe,
this can lead to engine damage.
If you
detect a persistent heavy spark knock even
when using gasoline of the stated octane
rating, or if you hear steady spark knock
while holding a steady speed on level roads,
it is recommended you have an INFINITI
retailer correct the condition. Failure to
correct the condition is misuse of the
vehicle, for which INFINITI is not respon-
sible.
Incorrect ignition timing will result in knock-
ing, after-run or overheating. This in turn
may cause excessive fuel consumption or

Technical and consumer information 10-5

damage to the engine. If any of the above
symptoms are encountered, have your ve-
hicle checked. It is recommended you visit an
INFINITI retailer for servicing.
However, now and then you may notice
light spark knock for a short time while
accelerating or driving up hills. This is no
cause for concern, because you get the
greatest fuel benefit when there is light
spark knock for a short time under heavy
engine load.

ENGINE OIL AND OIL FILTER
RECOMMENDATION

Selecting the correct oil
It is essential to choose the correct grade,
quality, and viscosity engine oil to ensure
satisfactory engine life and performance,
see “Capacities and recommended fluids/
lubricants” (P.10-2). INFINITI recommends
the use of an energy conserving oil in order
to improve fuel economy.
Select only engine oils that meet the Amer-
ican Petroleum Institute (API) certification

JVT0342X

or International Lubricant Standardization
and Approval Committee (ILSAC) certifica-
tion and SAE viscosity standard. These oils
have the API certification mark on the front
of the container. Oils which do not have the
specified quality label should not be used as
they could cause engine damage.

Oil additives
INFINITI does not recommend the use of oil
additives. The use of an oil additive is not
necessary when the proper oil type is used
and maintenance intervals are followed.
Oil which may contain foreign matter or has
been previously used should not be used.

Oil viscosity
The engine oil viscosity or thickness changes
with temperature. Because of this,
it is
important that the engine oil viscosity be
selected based on the temperatures at which
the vehicle will be operated before the next
oil change. Choosing an oil viscosity other
than that recommended could cause serious
engine damage.

Selecting the correct oil filter
Your new vehicle is equipped with a high-
quality genuine NISSAN oil filter. When
replacing, use the genuine oil filter or its
equivalent for the reason described in
change intervals.

Change intervals
The oil and oil filter change intervals for your
engine are based on the use of the specified
quality oils and filters. Oil and filter other
than the specified quality, or oil and filter
change intervals longer than recommended
could reduce engine life. Damage to engines
caused by improper maintenance or use of
incorrect oil and filter quality and/or vis-
cosity is not covered by the new INFINITI
vehicle limited warranties.
Your engine was filled with a high quality
engine oil when it was built. You do not have
to change the oil before the first recom-

mended change interval. Oil and filter
change intervals depend upon how you use
your vehicle.

AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM RE-
FRIGERANT AND LUBRICANT
RECOMMENDATIONS
The air conditioning system in your INFINITI
vehicle must be charged with the refriger-
ant HFC-134a (R-134a) and the lubricant,
NISSAN A/C system oil Type S or the exact
equivalents.

CAUTION

The use of any other refrigerant or
lubricant may cause severe damage to
the air conditioning system and may
require the replacement of all air condi-
tioner system components.

The refrigerant HFC-134a (R-134a) in your
INFINITI vehicle will not harm the earth’s
ozone layer. Although this refrigerant does
not affect the earth’s atmosphere, certain
governmental regulations require the recov-
ery and recycling of any refrigerant during
automotive air conditioning system service.
Your INFINITI retailer has the trained tech-
nicians and equipment needed to recover

and recycle your air conditioning system
refrigerant.
It is recommended you visit an INFINITI
retailer when servicing your air conditioning
system.

VEHICLE IDENTIFICATION

WHEN TRAVELING OR REGISTERING
IN ANOTHER COUNTRY

If you plan to travel in another country, you
should first find out if the fuel available is
suitable for your vehicle’s engine.
Using fuel with too low an octane rating may
cause engine damage. All gasoline vehicles
must be operated with unleaded gasoline.
Therefore, avoid taking your vehicle to areas
where appropriate fuel is not available.
When transferring the registration of your
vehicle to another country, state, province
or district, it may be necessary to modify the
vehicle to meet local laws and regulations.
The laws and regulations for motor vehicle
emission control and safety standards vary
according to the country, state, province or
district; therefore, vehicle specifications may
differ.
When any vehicle is to be taken into
another country, state, province or district
and registered, its modifications, transpor-
tation, and registration are the responsi-
bility of the user. INFINITI is not responsible
for any inconvenience that may result.

WARNING

.

It is extremely dangerous to
ride in a cargo area inside the
vehicle.
In a collision, people
riding in these areas are more
likely to be seriously injured or
killed.

. Do not allow people to ride in
any area of vehicle that is not
equipped with seats and seat
belts.

. Be sure everyone in your vehicle
is in a seat and using a seat belt
properly.

TERMS
It is important to familiarize yourself
with the following terms before load-
ing your vehicle:

gers and cargo.

. GVW (Gross Vehicle Weight) -
curb weight plus the combined
weight of passengers and cargo.

. GVWR (Gross Vehicle Weight Rat-
ing) - maximum total combined
weight of the unloaded vehicle,
passengers, luggage, hitch, trailer
tongue load and any other op-
tional equipment. This information
is located on the F.M.V.S.S./C.M.
V.S.S. label.

. GAWR (Gross Axle Weight Rating)
- maximum weight (load)

VEHICLE LOAD CAPACITY
Do not exceed the load limit of your
vehicle shown as “The combined
weight of occupants and cargo” on
the Tire and Loading Information
label. Do not exceed the number of
occupants shown as “Seating Capa-
city” on the Tire and Loading Infor-
mation label.
To get “the combined weight of
occupants and cargo”, add the weight
of all occupants, then add the total
luggage weight. Examples are shown
in the illustration.

Steps for determining correct load
limit
1. Locate the statement “The com-
bined weight of occupants and
cargo should never exceed XXX
kg or XXX lbs” on your vehicle’s
placard.

2. Determine the combined weight of
the driver and passengers that will
be riding in your vehicle.

3. Subtract the combined weight of

4. The resulting figure equals the
available amount of cargo and
luggage load capacity. For exam-
ple,
if the XXX amount equals
1400 lbs. and there will be five
150 lb. passengers in your vehicle,
the amount of available cargo and
luggage load capacity is 650 lbs.
(1400 − 750 (5 x 150) = 650 lbs) or
(640 − 340 (5 x 70) = 300 kg.)

5. Determine the combined weight of
luggage and cargo being loaded on
the vehicle. That weight may not
safely exceed the available cargo
and luggage load capacity calcu-
lated in Step 4.

6. If your vehicle will be towing a
trailer, load from your trailer will
be transferred to your vehicle.
Consult this manual to determine
how this reduces the available
cargo and luggage load capacity
of your vehicle.

SECURING THE LOAD
There are tie down hooks located in the
cargo area as shown. The tie down hooks
can be used to secure cargo with ropes or
other types of straps.
Do not apply a total load of more than 22 lb
(10 kg) to a single hook
or 7 lb (3 kg) to a
single hook when securing cargo.

WARNING

. Properly secure all cargo with ropes
or straps to help prevent it from
sliding or shifting. Do not place cargo
higher than the seatbacks. In a sud-

den stop or collision, unsecured cargo
could cause personal injury.

. The child restraint top tether strap
may be damaged by contact with
items in the cargo area. Secure any
items in the cargo area. Your child
could be seriously injured or killed in a
collision if the top tether strap is
damaged.

. Do not load your vehicle any heavier
than the GVWR or the maximum
front and rear GAWRs. If you do,
parts of your vehicle can break, tire
damage could occur, or it can change
the way your vehicle handles. This
could result in loss of control and
cause personal injury.

LOADING TIPS
. The GVW must not exceed GVWR
or GAWR as specified on the F.M.
V.S.S./C.M.V.S.S. certification la-
bel.

. Do not load the front and rear axle
to the GAWR. Doing so will exceed
the GVWR.

WARNING

. Properly secure all cargo to help
prevent it from sliding or shift-
ing. Do not place cargo higher
than the seatbacks. In a sudden
stop or collision, unsecured car-
go could cause personal injury.
. Do not load your vehicle any
heavier than the GVWR or the
m a x i m u m f r o n t a n d r e a r
GAWRs.
If you do, parts of
your vehicle can break, tire
damage could occur, or it can
change the way your vehicle
handles. This could result in loss
of control and cause personal
injury.

. Overloading not only can short-
en the life of your vehicle and
the tire, but can cause unsafe
vehicle handling and long brak-
ing distance. This may cause a
premature tire failure, which
could result in a serious acci-
dent and personal injury. Fail-

ures caused by overloading are
not covered by the vehicle’s
warranty.

MEASUREMENT OF WEIGHTS
Secure loose items to prevent weight
shifts that could affect the balance of
your vehicle. When the vehicle is
loaded, drive to a scale and weigh
the front and the rear wheels sepa-
rately to determine axle loads. Indivi-
dual axle loads should not exceed
either of the gross axle weight ratings
(GAWR). The total of the axle loads
should not exceed the gross vehicle
weight rating (GVWR). These ratings
are given on the vehicle certification
label. If weight ratings are exceeded,
move or remove items to bring all
weights below the ratings.

MAXIMUM LOAD LIMITS

Maximum trailer loads
Never allow the total trailer load to exceed
the value specified in the “Towing load/
specification” (P.10-21). The total trailer
load equals trailer weight plus its cargo
weight.
. When towing a trailer load of 3,500 lbs
(1,587 kg) or more, trailers with a brake
system MUST be used.

The maximum Gross Combined Weight
Rating (GCWR) should not exceed the value
specified in the following “Towing Load/
Specification” chart.

TOWING A TRAILER

WARNING

Overloading or improper loading of a
trailer and its cargo can adversely affect
vehicle handling, braking and perfor-
mance and may lead to accidents.

CAUTION

. Do not tow a trailer or haul a heavy
load for the first 500 miles (800 km).
Your engine, axle or other parts could
be damaged.

. For the first 500 miles (800 km) that
you tow a trailer, do not drive over
50 MPH (80 km/h) and do not make
starts at full throttle. This helps the
engine and other parts of your vehicle
wear in at the heavier loads.

Your new vehicle was designed to be used
primarily to carry passengers and cargo.
Remember that towing a trailer places
additional
loads on your vehicle’s engine,
drivetrain, steering, braking and other sys-
tems.

10-18 Technical and consumer information

STI0541

The GCWR equals the combined weight of
the towing vehicle (including passengers and
cargo) plus the total trailer load. Towing
loads greater than these or using improper
towing equipment could adversely affect
vehicle handling, braking and performance.
The ability of your vehicle to tow a trailer is
not only related to the maximum trailer
loads, but also the places you plan to tow.
Tow weights appropriate for level highway
driving may have to be reduced on very steep
grades or for low traction situations (for
example, on slippery boat ramps).
Temperature conditions can also affect
towing. For example, towing a heavy trailer
in high outside temperatures on graded

roads can affect engine performance and
cause overheating. The transmission high
fluid temperature and engine protection
mode, which helps reduce the chance of
transmission and engine damage, could
activate and automatically decrease engine
power. Vehicle speed may decrease under
high load. Plan your trip carefully to account
for trailer and vehicle load, weather and road
conditions.

WARNING

Overheating can result in reduced engine
power and vehicle speed. The reduced
speed may be lower than other traffic,
which could increase the chance of a
collision. Be especially careful when
driving. If the vehicle cannot maintain a
safe driving speed, pull to the side of the
road in a safe area. Allow the engine to
cool and return to normal operation. See
“If your vehicle overheats” (P.6-14).

CAUTION

Vehicle damage resulting from improper
towing procedures is not covered by
INFINITI warranties.

Tongue load
When using a weight carrying or a weight
distributing hitch, keep the tongue load
between 10 to 15% of the total trailer load
or use the trailer tongue load specified by the
trailer manufacturer. The tongue load must
be within the maximum tongue load limits
shown in the following “Towing Load/
Specification” chart.
If the tongue load
becomes excessive, rearrange cargo to allow
for proper tongue load.

combined weight of the unloaded vehicle,
passengers,
luggage, hitch, trailer tongue
load and any other optional equipment. In
addition, front or rear GAW must not exceed
the Gross Axle Weight Rating (GAWR)
shown on the F.M.V.S.S./C.M.V.S.S. certifi-

base vehicle with driver and any options
required to achieve the rating. Additional
passengers, cargo and/or optional equip-
ment, such as the trailer hitch, will add
weight to the vehicle and reduce your
vehicle’s maximum towing capacity and
trailer tongue load.
The vehicle and trailer need to be weighed to
confirm the vehicle is within the GVWR,
Front GAWR, Rear GAWR, Gross Combined
Weight Rating (GCWR) and Towing capa-
city.
All vehicle and trailer weights can be mea-
sured using platform type scales commonly
found at truck stops, highway weigh sta-
tions, building supply centers or salvage
yards.
To determine the available payload capacity
for tongue/king pin load, use the following
procedure.
1. Locate the GVWR on the F.M.V.S.S./C.

M.V.S.S. certification label.

2. Weigh your vehicle on the scale with all
of the passengers and cargo that are
normally in the vehicle when towing a
trailer.

3. Subtract the actual vehicle weight from
the GVWR. The remaining amount is the
available maximum tongue/king pin
load.

10-20 Technical and consumer information

To determine the available towing capacity,
use the following procedure.
1. Find the GCWR for your vehicle on the
“Towing Load/Specification” chart
found later in this section.

2. Subtract the actual vehicle weight from
the GCWR. The remaining amount is the
available maximum towing capacity.

To determine the Gross Trailer Weight,
weigh your trailer on a scale with all
equipment and cargo, that are normally in
the trailer when it is towed. Make sure the
Gross trailer weight is not more than the
Gross Trailer Weight Rating shown on the
trailer and is not more than the calculated
available maximum towing capacity.
Also weigh the front and rear axles on the
scale to make sure the Front Gross Axle
Weight and Rear Gross Axle Weight are not
more than Front Gross Axle Weight and
Rear Gross Axle Weight on the F.M.V.S.S./
C.M.V.S.S. certification label. The cargo in
the trailer and vehicle may need to be moved
or removed to meet the specified ratings.
Example:
. Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW) as weighed
on a scale - including passengers, cargo
and hitch - 6,450 lb. (2,926 kg).

. Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR)
from F.M.V.S.S./C.M.V.S.S. certification
label - 7,300 lb. (3,311 kg).

. Gross Combined Weight Rating (GCWR)

TOWING SAFETY

Trailer hitch
Your vehicle is equipped with a trailer tow
package. The trailer tow package includes a
receiver-type frame mounted hitch. This
hitch is rated for the maximum towing
capacity of this vehicle when the proper
towing equipment is used. Choose a proper
ball mount and hitch ball that is rated for the
trailer to be towed. Genuine INFINITI ball
mounts and hitch balls are available from an
INFINITI retailer.

capable of towing a trailer heavier than
the weight rating of the hitch compo-
nents. Never exceed the weight rating of
the hitch components. Doing so can

Technical and consumer information 10-23

cause serious personal injury or property
damage.

Hitch ball
Choose a hitch ball of the proper size and
weight rating for your trailer:
. The required hitch ball size is stamped on
most trailer couplers. Most hitch balls
also have the size printed on top of the
ball.

. Choose the proper class hitch ball based

on the trailer weight.

. The diameter of the threaded shank of
the hitch ball must be matched to the ball
mount hole diameter. The hitch ball
shank should be no more than 1/16”
smaller than the hole in the ball mount.
. The threaded shank of the hitch ball must
be long enough to be properly secured to
the ball mount. There should be at least 2
threads showing beyond the lock washer
and nut.

Ball mount
The hitch ball is attached to the ball mount
and the ball mount is inserted into the hitch
receiver. Choose a proper class ball mount
based on the trailer weight. Additionally, the
ball mount should be chosen to keep the
trailer tongue level with the ground.

10-24 Technical and consumer information

Weight carrying hitches
A weight carrying or “dead weight” ball
mount is one that is designed to carry the
whole amount of tongue weight and gross
weight directly on the ball mount and on the
receiver.

Weight distribution hitch
This type of hitch is also called a “load-
leveling” or “equalizing” hitch. A set of bars
attach to the ball mount and to the trailer to
distribute the tongue weight (hitch weight)
of your trailer. Many vehicles cannot carry
the full tongue weight of a given trailer, and
need some of the tongue weight transferred
through the frame and pushing down on the
front wheels. This gives stability to the tow
vehicle.
A weight-distributing hitch system (Class IV)
is recommended if you plan to tow trailers
with a maximum weight over 5,000 lbs
(2,267 kg). Check with the trailer and towing
equipment manufacturers to determine if
they recommend the use of a weight-
distributing hitch system.

NOTE:
A weight-distributing hitch system may
affect the operation of trailer surge brakes.
If you are considering use of a weight-
distributing hitch system with a surge

brake-equipped trailer, check with the
surge brake, hitch or trailer manufacturer
to determine if and how this can be done.
Follow the instructions provided by the
manufacturer for installing and using the
weight-distributing hitch system.
General set-up instructions are as follows:
1. Park unloaded vehicle on a level surface.
With the ignition switch in the ON
position and the doors closed, allow the
vehicle to stand for several minutes so
that it can level.

2. Measure the height of a reference point
on the front and rear bumpers at the
center of the vehicle.

3. Attach the trailer to the vehicle and
adjust the hitch equalizers so that the
front bumper height is within 0 - .5
inches (0 - 13 mm) of the reference
height measured in step 2. The rear
bumper should be no higher than the
reference height measured in step 2.

WARNING

Properly adjust the weight distributing
hitch so the rear of the bumper is no
higher than the measured reference
height when the trailer is attached. If
the rear bumper is higher than the

measured reference height when loaded,
the vehicle may handle unpredictably
which could cause a loss of vehicle
control and cause serious personal injury
or property damage.

Sway control device
Sudden maneuvers, wind gusts and buffet-
ing caused by other vehicles can affect
trailer handling. Sway control devices may
be used to help control these affects. If you
choose to use one, contact a reputable
trailer hitch supplier to make sure the sway
control device will work with the vehicle,
hitch, trailer and the trailer’s brake system.
Follow the instructions provided by the
manufacturer for installing and using the
sway control device.

Class I hitch
Class I trailer hitch equipment (receiver, ball
mount and hitch ball) can be used to tow
trailers of a maximum weight of 2,000 lb
(907 kg).

Class II hitch
Class II trailer hitch equipment (receiver, ball
mount and hitch ball) can be used to tow
trailers of a maximum weight of 3,500 lb
(1,588 kg).

Class III hitch
Class III trailer hitch equipment (receiver, ball
mount and hitch ball) can be used to tow
trailers of a maximum weight of 5,000 lb
(2,267 kg).

Class IV hitch
Class IV trailer hitch equipment (receiver, ball
mount and hitch ball) can be used to tow
trailers of a maximum weight of 10,000 lb
(4,545 kg). A weight distributing hitch
should be used to tow trailers that weigh
over 5,000 lb (2,267 kg).
Your vehicle may be equipped with Class IV
trailer hitch equipment that has a 10,000 lb
(4,545 kg) maximum weight rating, but your
vehicle is only capable of towing the max-
imum trailer weights shown in the “Towing
Load/Specification” chart earlier in this
section.

CAUTION

. Do not use axle-mounted hitches.
. Do not modify the vehicle exhaust

system, brake system, etc.

. Do not attach any additional hitches
to your vehicle because a hitch is
already mounted to your vehicle

frame.

Tire pressures
. When towing a trailer, inflate the
vehicle tires to the recommended
cold tire pressure indicated on the
Tire and Loading Information la-
bel.

. Trailer tire condition, size,

load
rating and proper inflation pres-
sure should be in accordance with
the trailer and tire manufacturers’
specifications.

Safety chains
Always use a suitable chain between your
vehicle and the trailer. The safety chains
should be crossed and should be attached to
the hitch, not to the vehicle bumper or axle.
Be sure to leave enough slack in the chains to
permit turning corners.

the vehicle tail
light, stoplight and
turn signal circuits as a signal source.
The module/converter must draw no
more than 15 milliamps from the stop

ule/converter that exceeds these
power requirements may damage
the vehicle’s electrical system. See a
reputable trailer retailer to obtain the
proper equipment and to have it
installed.

. Do not connect electrical devices that
draw more than 40 amps to the
vehicle. The fusible link may melt.

Trailer lights should comply with federal
and/or local regulations. For assistance in
hooking up trailer lights, contact an INFINITI
retailer or reputable trailer retailer.

Trailer brakes
When towing a trailer load of 3,500 lbs.
(1,587 kg) or more, trailers with a brake
system MUST be used. However, most
states require a separate braking system on
trailers with a loaded weight above a
specific amount. Make sure the trailer meets
the local regulations and the regulations
where you plan to tow.
Several types of braking systems are avail-
able.

Surge Brakes - The surge brake actuator is
mounted on the trailer tongue with a
hydraulic line running to each trailer wheel.
Surge brakes are activated by the trailer
pushing against the hitch ball when the tow
vehicle is braking. Hydraulic surge brakes are
common on rental trailers and some boat
trailers. In this type of system, there is no
hydraulic or electric connection for brake
operation between the tow vehicle and the
trailer.
Electric Trailer Brakes - Electric braking
systems are activated by an electronic signal
sent from a trailer brake controller (special
brake sensing module).
Have a professional supplier of towing
equipment make sure the trailer brakes are
properly installed and demonstrate proper
brake function testing.

WARNING

Never connect a trailer brake system
directly to the vehicle brake system.

Pre-towing tips
. Be certain your vehicle maintains a level
position when a loaded or unloaded
trailer is hitched. Do not drive the vehicle
if it has an abnormal nose-up or nose-

tongue load, overload, worn suspension
or other possible causes of either condi-
tion.

. Always secure items in the trailer to

prevent load shift while driving.

. Keep the cargo load as low as possible in
the trailer to keep the trailer center of
gravity low.

. Load the trailer so approximately 60% of
the trailer load is in the front half and
40% is in the back half. Also make sure
the load is balanced side to side.

. Check your hitch, trailer tire pressure,
vehicle tire pressure, trailer light opera-
tion, and trailer wheel lug nuts every time
you attach a trailer to the vehicle.

. Be certain your rearview mirrors conform
to all federal, state or local regulations. If
not,
install any mirrors required for
towing before driving the vehicle.

. Determine the overall height of the
vehicle and trailer so the required clear-
ance is known.

Trailer towing tips
In order to gain skill and an understanding of
the vehicle’s behavior, you should practice
turning, stopping and backing up in an area
which is free from traffic. Steering stability,
and braking performance will be somewhat

different than under normal driving condi-
tions.
. Always secure items in the trailer to

prevent load shift while driving.

. Lock the trailer hitch coupler with a pin or
lock to prevent the coupler from inad-
vertently becoming unlatched.

. Avoid abrupt starts, acceleration or

stops.

. Avoid sharp turns or lane changes.
. Always drive your vehicle at a moderate
speed. Some states or provinces have
specific speed limits for vehicles that are
towing trailers. Obey the local speed
limits.

. When backing up, hold the bottom of the
steering wheel with one hand. Move
your hand in the direction in which you
want the trailer to go. Make small
corrections and back up slowly. If possi-
ble, have someone guide you when you
are backing up.

Always block the wheels on both vehicle and
trailer when parking. Parking on a slope is
not recommended; however, if you must do
so:

CAUTION

If you move the shift lever to the P
(Park) position before blocking the
wheels and applying the parking brake,
transmission damage could occur.

1. Apply and hold the brake pedal.
2. Have someone place blocks on the
downhill side of the vehicle and trailer
wheels.

3. After the wheel blocks are in place,
slowly release the brake pedal until the
blocks absorb the vehicle load.

4. Apply the parking brake.
5. Shift the transmission into P (Park).
6. Four-Wheel Drive (4WD) models:

Make sure that the 4WD shift switch is
engaged in the AUTO, 4HI or 4LO
position and the Automatic Transmission
(AT) park warning light is turned off.

7. Turn off the engine.
To drive away:
1. Apply and hold the brake pedal.
2. Start the engine.
3. Shift the transmission into gear.

Technical and consumer information 10-27

4. Release the parking brake.
5. Drive slowly until the vehicle and trailer

are clear from the blocks.

6. Apply and hold the brake pedal.
7. Have someone retrieve and store the

blocks.

. While going downhill, the weight of the
trailer pushing on the tow vehicle may
decrease overall stability. Therefore, to
maintain adequate control, reduce your
speed and shift to a lower gear. Avoid
long or repeated use of the brakes when
descending a hill, as this reduces their
effectiveness and could cause overheat-
ing. Shifting to a lower gear instead
provides “engine braking” and reduces
the need to brake as frequently.
If the engine coolant temperature rises to
a high temperature, see “If your vehicle
overheats” (P.6-14).

. Trailer towing requires more fuel than

.

normal circumstances.

. Avoid towing a trailer for your vehicle’s

first 500 miles (800 km).

. Have your vehicle serviced more often
than at intervals specified in the recom-
mended maintenance schedule shown in
the “9. Maintenance and schedules”
section.

10-28 Technical and consumer information

. When making a turn, your trailer wheels
will be closer to the inside of the turn
than your vehicle wheels. To compensate
for this, make a larger than normal
turning radius during the turn.

. Crosswinds and rough roads will ad-
versely affect vehicle/trailer handling,
possibly causing vehicle sway. When
being passed by larger vehicles, be pre-
pared for possible changes in crosswinds
that could affect vehicle handling.

Do the following if the trailer begins to sway:
1. Take your foot off the accelerator pedal
to allow the vehicle to coast and steer as
straight ahead as the road conditions
allow. This combination will help stabilize
the vehicle.
. Do not correct trailer sway by steering

or applying the brakes.

2. When the trailer sway stops, gently
apply the brakes and pull to the side of
the road in a safe area.

3. Try to rearrange the trailer load so it is
balanced as described earlier in this
section.

. Be careful when passing other vehicles.
Passing while towing a trailer requires
considerably more distance than normal
passing. Remember the length of the
trailer must also pass the other vehicle
before you can safely change lanes.

. Use the TOW mode or downshift the
transmission to a lower gear for engine
braking when driving down steep or long
hills. This will help slow the vehicle
without applying the brakes.

. Avoid holding the brake pedal down too
long or too frequently. This could cause
the brakes to overheat, resulting in
reduced braking efficiency.
Increase your following distance to allow
for greater stopping distances while
towing a trailer. Anticipate stops and
brake gradually.
INFINITI recommends that the cruise
control not be used while towing a
trailer.

. While towing a trailer, do not use the

.

.

following systems (if so equipped):
— the Lane Departure Warning (LDW)

— the Lane Departure Prevention (LDP)

— the Blind Spot Warning (BSW) system
— the Blind Spot Intervention® (BSI)

— the Back-up Collision Intervention

. Some states or provinces have specific
regulations and speed limits for vehicles
that are towing trailers. Obey the local
speed limits.

. Check your hitch, trailer wiring harness
connections, and trailer wheel lug nuts
after 50 miles (80 km) of travel and at
every break.

. When launching a boat, do not allow the
water level to go over the exhaust tail
pipe or rear bumper.

. Make sure you disconnect the trailer
lights before backing the trailer into the
water or the trailer lights may burn out.
When towing a trailer, the transmission
fluid should be changed more frequently.
For additional information, see “9. Main-
tenance and schedules” section.

TOW mode
Using TOW mode is recommended when
pulling a heavy trailer or hauling a heavy
load. Push the TOW mode switch to activate
TOW mode. The TOW mode indicator light
in the meter illuminates when TOW mode is
selected. Push the TOW mode switch again

to turn TOW mode off. TOW mode is
automatically cancelled when the ignition
switch is placed in the OFF position.
TOW mode includes the following features:
. Grade logic — Adjusts transmission shifts
when pulling a trailer or hauling a load up
a grade.

. Downhill Speed Control (DSC) — auto-
matically downshifts when driving down
a grade with a trailer or heavy load to
help control vehicle speed.

Driving the vehicle in the TOW mode with no
trailer/load or light trailer/light load will not
cause any damage. However, fuel economy
may be reduced and the transmission/
engine driving characteristics may feel unu-
sual.
When towing a trailer, the transmission
fluid should be changed more frequently.
For additional information, see “9. Main-
tenance and schedules” section.

Trailer Sway Control
To minimize trailer sway, your vehicle may
apply braking to individual wheels based on
input from your vehicle sensors and vehicle
speed. Trailer Sway Control is a function of
the Vehicle Dynamic Control (VDC) system
and is active when the VDC function is
enabled.

CAUTION

If the VDC OFF switch is on (meaning
VDC system OFF), the Trailer Sway
Control is also disabled.

When Trailer Sway Control is in operation,
the VDC warning light blinks. When vehicle
control is regained, VDC warning light will
turn OFF.
For additional information about the VDC
system, see “Vehicle Dynamic Control (VDC)
system” (P.5-133).

If Trailer Sway Control activates:
1. Take your foot off the accelerator pedal
to allow the vehicle to coast and steer as
straight ahead as the road conditions
allow. This combination will help stabilize
the vehicle.

CAUTION

Do not try to correct trailer sway by
steering or applying the brakes.

2. When the trailer sway stops, gently
apply the brakes and pull to the side of
the road in a safe area.

INFINITI” (P.6-16).

Automatic Transmission
Four-Wheel Drive (4WD) models:
Do not tow a 4WD vehicle with any of the
wheels on the ground.

Two-Wheel Drive (2WD) models:
To tow a vehicle equipped with an automatic
transmission, an appropriate vehicle dolly
MUST be placed under the towed vehicle’s
drive wheels. Always follow the dolly man-
ufacturer’s recommendations when using
their product.

UNIFORM TIRE QUALITY GRADING

DOT (Department Of Transportation) Qual-
ity Grades: All passenger car tires must
conform to federal safety requirements in
addition to these grades.
Quality grades can be found where applic-
able on the tire sidewall between tread
shoulder and maximum section width. For
example:
Treadwear 200 Traction AA Temperature A

TREADWEAR
The treadwear grade is a comparative rating
based on the wear rate of the tire when
tested under controlled conditions on a
specified government test course. For ex-
ample, a tire graded 150 would wear one
and one-half (1 1/2) times as well on the
government course as a tire graded 100.
The relative performance of tires depends
upon actual conditions of their use, however,
and may depart significantly from the norm
due to variations in driving habits, service
practices and differences in road character-
istics and climate.

3. Try to rearrange the trailer load so it is

balanced.

NOTE:
Trailer Sway Control cannot reduce trailer
sway in all situations.
FLAT TOWING
Towing your vehicle with all four wheels on
the ground is sometimes called flat towing.
This method is sometimes used when towing
a vehicle behind a recreational vehicle, such
as a motor home.

CAUTION

. Failure to follow these guidelines can
result in severe transmission damage.
. Whenever flat towing your vehicle,
always tow forward, never back-
ward.

. DO NOT tow any automatic trans-
mission vehicle with all four wheels
on the ground (flat towing). Doing so
WILL DAMAGE internal transmis-
sion parts due to lack of transmission
lubrication.

. DO NOT tow a Four-Wheel Drive
(4WD) vehicle with any of the wheels
on the ground. Doing so may cause
serious and expensive damage to the

10-30 Technical and consumer information

Safety Standard No. 109. Grades B and A
represent higher levels of performance on
the laboratory test wheel than the minimum
required by law.

WARNING

The temperature grade for this tire is
established for a tire that is properly
inflated and not overloaded. Excessive
speed, under-inflation, or excessive
loading, either separately or in combina-
tion, can cause heat build-up and possi-
ble tire failure.

TRACTION AA, A, B AND C
The traction grades, from highest to lowest,
are AA, A, B and C. Those grades represent
the tire’s ability to stop on wet pavement as
measured under controlled conditions on
specified government test surfaces of as-
phalt and concrete. A tire marked C may
have poor traction performance.

WARNING

The traction grade assigned to this tire is
based on straight-ahead braking trac-
tion tests, and does not include accel-
eration, cornering, hydroplaning, or peak
traction characteristics.

TEMPERATURE A, B AND C
The temperature grades A (the highest), B,
and C, representing the tire’s resistance to
the generation of heat and its ability to
dissipate heat when tested under controlled
conditions on a specified indoor laboratory
test wheel. Sustained high temperature can
cause the material of the tire to degenerate
and reduce tire life, and excessive tempera-
ture can lead to sudden tire failure. The
grade C corresponds to a level of perfor-
mance which all passenger car tires must
meet under the Federal Motor Vehicle

READINESS FOR INSPECTION/
MAINTENANCE (I/M) TEST

WARNING

A vehicle equipped with Four-Wheel
Drive (4WD) should never be tested
using a two wheel dynamometer (such
as the dynamometers used by some
states for emissions testing), or similar
equipment. Make sure you inform test
facility personnel that your vehicle is
equipped with 4WD before it is placed
on a dynamometer. Using the wrong test
equipment may result in transmission
damage or unexpected vehicle move-
ment which could result in serious vehicle
damage or personal injury.

Due to legal requirements in some states and
Canadian Provinces, your vehicle may be
required to be in what is called the “ready
condition” for an Inspection/Maintenance
(I/M) test of the emission control system.
The vehicle is set to the “ready condition”
when it is driven through certain driving
patterns. Usually, the “ready condition” can
be obtained by ordinary usage of the vehicle.
If a powertrain system component is re-
paired or the battery is disconnected, the
vehicle may be reset to a “not ready condi-
tion”. Before taking the I/M test, check the
vehicle’s inspection/maintenance test readi-

ness condition. Place the ignition switch in
the ON position without starting the engine.
If the Malfunction Indicator Light (MIL)
comes on steady for 20 seconds and then
blinks for 10 seconds, the I/M test condition
is “not ready”. If the MIL does not blink after
20 seconds, the I/M test condition is
“ready”.
It is recommended you visit an INFINITI
retailer to set “ready condition” or to prepare
the vehicle for testing.

EVENT DATA RECORDERS (EDR)

This vehicle is equipped with an Event Data
Recorder (EDR). The main purpose of an
EDR is to record, in certain crash or near
crash-like situations, such as an air bag
deployment or hitting a road obstacle, data
that will assist in understanding how a
vehicle’s systems performed. The EDR is
designed to record data related to vehicle
dynamics and safety systems for a short
period of time, typically 30 seconds or less.
The EDR in this vehicle is designed to record
such data as:
. How various systems in your vehicle were

operating;

. Whether or not the driver and passenger

safety belts were buckled/fastened;

. How far (if at all) the driver was depres-
sing the accelerator and/or brake pedal;
and,

. How fast the vehicle was traveling.
. Sounds are not recorded.
These data can help provide a better under-
standing of the circumstances in which
crashes and injuries occur.
NOTE: EDR data are recorded by your
vehicle only if a nontrivial crash situation
occurs; no data are recorded by the EDR
under normal driving conditions and no
personal data (e.g. name, gender, age and
crash location) are recorded. However, other
parties, such as law enforcement, could

GAS STATION INFORMATION

FUEL INFORMATION

VK56VD engine
INFINITI recommends the use of unleaded
premium gasoline with an octane rating of at
least 91 AKI
(Anti-Knock Index) number
(Research octane number 96).
If unleaded premium gasoline is not avail-
able, you may use unleaded regular gasoline
with an octane rating of at least 87 AKI
number (Research octane number 91), but
you may notice a decrease in performance.

CAUTION

. Using a fuel other than that specified
could adversely affect the emission
control systems, and may also affect
warranty coverage.

. Under no circumstances should a
leaded gasoline be used, because this
will damage the three way catalyst.
. Do not use E-15 or E-85 fuel in your
vehicle. Your vehicle is not designed
to run on E-15 or E-85 fuel. Using E-
15 or E-85 fuel
in a vehicle not
specifically designed for E-15 or E-
85 fuel can adversely affect the

emission control devices and systems
of the vehicle. Damage caused by
such fuel
is not covered by the
INFINITI new vehicle limited war-
ranty.

. Do not use fuel that contains the
octane booster methylcyclopentadie-
nyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT).
Using fuel containing MMT may
adversely affect vehicle performance
and vehicle emissions. Not all fuel
dispensers are labeled to indicate
MMT content, so you may have to
consult your gasoline retailer for
more details. Note that Federal and
California laws prohibit the use of
MMT in reformulated gasoline.

. U.S. government regulations require
ethanol dispensing pumps to be iden-
tified by a small, square, orange and
black label with the common abbre-
viation or the appropriate percen-
tage for that region.

ENGINE OIL RECOMMENDA-
TION:
. Genuine “NISSAN Motor Oil 0W-20

SN”.

See “Capacities and recommended fluids/
lubricants” (P.10-2) for engine oil and oil
filter recommendation.

COLD TIRE PRESSURES:
The label is typically located on the driver
side center pillar or on the driver’s door. For
additional
information, see “Wheels and
tires” (P.8-27).

NEW VEHICLE BREAK-IN PRO-
CEDURES RECOMMENDATION:
During the first 1,200 miles (2,000 km) of
vehicle use, follow the recommendations
outlined in the “Break-in schedule” (P.5-
119). Follow these recommendations for
the future reliability and economy of your
new vehicle.
