Essential Safety Equipment

Seats

WARNING

Seat Precautions

Make sure the adjustable components of a seat are locked in place:
Adjustable seats and seatbacks that are not securely locked are dangerous. In a sudden stop
or collision, the seat or seatback could move, causing injury. Make sure the adjustable
components of the seat are locked in place by attempting to slide the seat forward and
backward and rocking the seatback.

Never allow children to adjust a seat:
Allowing children to adjust a seat is dangerous as it could result in serious injury if a child's
hands or feet become caught in the seat.

Do not drive with the seatback unlocked:
All of the seatbacks play an important role in your protection in a vehicle. Leaving the
seatback unlocked is dangerous as it can allow passengers to be ejected or thrown around
and baggage to strike occupants in a sudden stop or collision, resulting in severe injury. After
adjusting the seatback at any time, even when there are no other passengers, rock the
seatback to make sure it is locked in place.

Adjust the driver's seat only when the vehicle is stopped:
Adjusting the driver's seat while the vehicle is moving is dangerous. The driver could lose
control of the vehicle and have an accident.

Do not modify or replace the front seats:
Modifying or replacing the front seats such as replacing the upholstery or loosening any bolts
is dangerous. The front seats contain air bag components essential to the supplemental
restraint system. Such modifications could damage the supplemental restraint system and
result in serious injury. Consult an Authorized Mazda Repairer if there is any need to remove
or reinstall the front seats.

Do not drive with damaged front seats:
Driving with damaged front seats, such as seat cushions torn or damaged down to the
urethane, is dangerous. A collision, even one not strong enough to inflate the air bags, could
damage the front seats which contain essential air bag components. If there was a
subsequent collision, an air bag may not deploy which could lead to injuries. Always have an
Authorized Mazda Repairer inspect the front seats, front seat belt pretensioners and air bags
after a collision.

Essential Safety Equipment

Seats

Do not drive with either front seats reclined:
Sitting in a reclined position while the vehicle is moving is dangerous because you do not get
the full protection from seat belts. During sudden braking or a collision, you can slide under
the lap belt and suffer serious internal injuries. For maximum protection, sit well back and
upright.

Do not recline a second-row seatback when the third-row seat is occupied:
Reclining the second-row seatback when the third-row seat is occupied is dangerous. Because
the clearance in the third-row seat is limited, occupants in the third-row seat could be hurt
seriously on a reclined second-row seatback.

Do not place an object such as a cushion between the seatback and your back:
Putting an object such as a cushion between the seatback and your back is dangerous
because you will be unable to maintain a safe driving posture and the seat belt cannot
function at its full capacity in a collision, which could result in a serious accident, injury or
death.

Do not place objects under the seat:
The object could get stuck and cause the seat to not be fixed securely, and result in an
accident.

Do not stack cargo higher than the seatbacks:
Stacking luggage or other cargo higher than the seatbacks is dangerous. During sudden
braking or a collision, objects can fly around and become projectiles that may hit and injure
passengers.

Make sure luggage and cargo is secured before driving:
Not securing cargo while driving is dangerous as it could move or be crushed during sudden
braking or a collision and cause injury.

Never allow a passenger to sit or stand on the folded seatback while the vehicle is moving:
Driving with a passenger on the folded seatback is dangerous. Allowing a child to sit up on
the folded seatback while the vehicle is moving is particularly dangerous. In a sudden stop or
even a minor collision, a child not in a proper seat or child-restraint system and seat belt could
be thrown forward, back or even out of the vehicle resulting in serious injuries or death. The
child in the baggage area could be thrown into other occupants and cause serious injury.

Essential Safety Equipment

Seats

CAUTION

When operating a seat, be careful not to put your hands or fingers near the moving parts of

the seat or on the side trim to prevent injury.

When moving the seats, make sure there is no cargo in the surrounding area. If the cargo

gets caught it could damage the cargo.

(Manual Seat)

When moving the seats forward and rearward or returning a rear-reclined seatback to its
upright position, make sure you hold onto the seatback with your hand while operating. If
the seatback is not held, the seat will move suddenly and could cause injury.

NOTE
• When returning a rear seat to its original position, place the seat belt in its normal
position. Verify that the seat belt pulls out and retracts.
• (Power Seat)
The seat-bottom power adjustment is operated by motors. Avoid extended operation
because excessive use can damage the motors.
• To prevent the battery from running down, avoid using the power adjustment when the
engine is stopped. The adjuster uses a large amount of electrical power.
• Do not use the switch to make more than one adjustment at a time.

Do not place heavy objects with sharp
projections on the seat, or insert needles or
pins into it:
This could cause the seat to become
excessively heated and result in injury from
a minor burn.

CAUTION

Do not use organic solvents to clean the
seat. It may damage the seat surface and
the heater.

NOTE
• If the ignition is switched off while the

Essential Safety Equipment

Seat Belt Systems

Seat Belt Precautions

Seat belts help to decrease the possibility of severe injury during accidents and sudden
stops. Mazda recommends that the driver and all passengers always wear seat belts.
 
All the seats have lap/shoulder belts. These belts also have retractors with inertia locks that
keep them out of the way when not in use. The locks allow the belts to remain comfortable
on users, but they will lock in position during a collision.

WARNING

Always wear your seat belt and make sure all occupants are properly restrained:
Not wearing a seat belt is extremely dangerous. During a collision, occupants not wearing
seat belts could hit someone or things inside the vehicle or even be thrown out of the vehicle.
They could be seriously injured or even killed. In the same collision, occupants wearing seat
belts would be much safer.

Do not wear twisted seat belts:
Twisted seat belts are dangerous. In a collision, the full width of the belt is not available to
absorb the impact. This puts more force on the bones beneath the belt, which could cause
serious injury or death. So, if your seat belt is twisted, you must straighten the seat belt to
remove any twists and to allow the full width of the belt to be used.

Never use one seat belt on more than one person at a time:
Using one seat belt for more than one person at a time is dangerous. A seat belt used in this
way cannot spread the impact forces properly and the two passengers could be crushed
together and seriously injured or even killed. Never use one belt for more than one person at a
time and always operate the vehicle with each occupant properly restrained.

Do not operate a vehicle with a damaged seat belt:
Using a damaged seat belt is dangerous. An accident could damage the belt webbing of the
seat belt in use. A damaged seat belt cannot provide adequate protection in a collision. Have
an expert repairer, we recommend an Authorized Mazda Repairer inspect all seat belt systems
in use during an accident before they are used again.

Essential Safety Equipment

Seat Belt Systems

Have your seat belts changed immediately if the pretensioner or load limiter has been
expended:
Always have an expert repairer, we recommend an Authorized Mazda Repairer immediately
inspect the seat belt pretensioners and air bags after any collision. Like the air bags, the seat
belt pretensioners and load limiters will only function once and must be replaced after any
collision that caused them to deploy. If the seat belt pretensioners and load limiters are not
replaced, the risk of injury in a collision will increase.

Positioning the Shoulder Portion of the Seat Belt:
Improper positioning of the shoulder portion of the seat belt is dangerous. Always make sure
the shoulder portion of the seat belt is positioned across your shoulder and near your neck,
but never under your arm, on your neck, or on your upper arm.

Positioning the Lap Portion of the Seat Belt:
The lap portion of the seat belt worn too high is dangerous. In a collision, this would
concentrate the impact force directly on the abdominal area, causing serious injury. Wear the
lap portion of the belt snugly and as low as possible.
 
In a rollover crash, an unbelted person is significantly more likely to die than a person wearing
a seat belt.
 

Instructions for Use of Seat Belt Assemblies:
Seatbelts are designed to bear upon the bony structure of the body, and should be worn low
across the front of the pelvis or the pelvis, chest and shoulders, as applicable; wearing the lap
section of the belt across the abdominal area must be avoided.
Seatbelts should be adjusted as firmly as possible, consistent with comfort, to provide the
protection for which they have been designed. A slack belt will greatly reduce the protection
afforded to the wearer.
Care should be taken to avoid contamination of the webbing with polishes, oils and
chemicals, and particularly battery acid. Cleaning may safely be carried out using mild soap
and water. The belt should be replaced if webbing becomes frayed, contaminated or
damaged.
It is essential to replace the entire assembly after it has been worn in a severe impact even if
damage to the assembly is not obvious.
Belts should not be worn with straps twisted.
Each belt assembly must only be used by one occupant; it is dangerous to put a belt around a
child being carried on the occupant's lap.
No modifications or additions should be made by the user which will either prevent the seat
belt adjusting devices from operating to remove slack, or prevent the seat belt assembly from
being adjusted to remove slack.

▼ Pregnant Women and Persons with Serious Medical Conditions
Pregnant women should always wear seat belts. Ask your doctor for specific
recommendations.
The lap belt should be worn SNUGLY AND AS LOW AS POSSIBLE OVER THE HIPS.
The shoulder belt should be worn across your shoulder properly, but never across the
stomach area.
Persons with serious medical conditions also should wear seat belts. Check with your doctor
for any special instructions regarding specific medical conditions.

▼ Emergency Locking Mode
When the seat belt is fastened, it will always be in the emergency locking mode.
In the emergency locking mode, the belt remains comfortable on the occupant and the
retractor will lock in position during a collision.
If the belt is locked and cannot be pulled out, retract the belt once, and then try pulling it out
slowly. If this fails, pull the belt strongly one time and loosen, then pull it out again slowly.

For optimum protection, the driver and
front passenger seat belts are equipped
with pretensioner and load limiting
systems. For both these systems to work
properly you must wear the seat belt
properly.
 
Pretensioners:
When a collision is detected, the
pretensioners deploy simultaneously with
the air bags.
(European models)
The pretensioners deploy simultaneously
with the air bags when a roll-over is also
detected.
For deployment details, refer to the SRS
Air Bag Deployment Criteria (page 2-

The seat belt retractors remove slack
quickly as the air bags are expanding. Any
time the air bags and seat belt
pretensioners have fired they must be
replaced.

Essential Safety Equipment

Seat Belt Systems

Load limiter:
The load limiting system releases belt
webbing in a controlled manner to reduce
belt force on the occupant's chest. While
the most severe load on a seat belt occurs
in frontal collisions, the load limiter has an
automatic mechanical function and can
activate in any accident mode with
sufficient occupant movement.
Even if the pretensioners have not fired,
the load limiting function must be checked
by an expert repairer, we recommend an
Authorized Mazda Repairer.

WARNING

Wear seat belts only as recommended in
this owner's manual:
Incorrect positioning of the seat belts is
dangerous. Without proper positioning, the
pretensioner and load limiting systems
cannot provide adequate protection in an
accident and this could result in serious
injury. For more details about wearing seat
belts, refer to "Fastening the Seat Belt"
(page 2-23).

Have your seat belts changed immediately
if the pretensioner or load limiter has been
expended:
Always have an expert repairer, we
recommend an Authorized Mazda Repairer
immediately inspect the seat belt
pretensioners and air bags after any

Seat Belt Systems

Do not modify the components or wiring,
or use electronic testing devices on the
pretensioner system:
Modifying the components or wiring of the
pretensioner system, including the use of
electronic testing devices is dangerous. You
could accidentally activate it or make it
inoperable which would prevent it from
activating in an accident. The occupants or
repairers could be seriously injured.

Properly dispose of the pretensioner
system:
Improper disposal of the pretensioner
system or a vehicle with non-deactivated
pretensioners is dangerous. Unless all
safety procedures are followed, injury could
result. Have an expert repairer, we
recommend an Authorized Mazda Repairer
safely dispose of the pretensioner system or
scrap a pretensioner system equipped

NOTE
• The pretensioner system may not
operate depending on the type of the
collision. For details, refer to the SRS
Air Bag Deployment Criteria (page 2-
55).
• Some smoke (non-toxic gas) will be
released when the air bags and
pretensioners deploy. This does not
indicate a fire. This gas normally has no
effect on occupants, however, those with
sensitive skin may experience light skin
irritation. If residue from the
deployment of the air bags or the
pretensioner system gets on the skin or

Child Restraint

Child-Restraint Precautions

Mazda strongly urges the use of child-restraint systems for children small enough to use
them.
Mazda recommends use of a Mazda genuine child-restraint system or one that complies
with the UNECE*1 44 regulation. If you would like to purchase a Mazda genuine
child-restraint system, please contact an Authorized Mazda Dealer.
Check your local and state or provincial laws for specific requirements regarding the safety
of children riding in your vehicle.
*1 UNECE stands for United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.
 
Whatever child-restraint system you consider, please pick the appropriate one for the age
and size of the child, obey the law and follow the instructions that come with the individual
child-restraint system.
 
A child who has outgrown child-restraint systems should sit in the rear and use seat belts.
 
The child-restraint system should be installed on the rear seat.
Statistics confirm that the rear seat is the best place for all children up to 12 years of age-the
more so with a supplemental restraint system (air bags).
 
A rear-facing child-restraint system should NEVER be used in the front passenger seat with
the air bag system activated. The front passenger's seat is also the least preferred seat for
other child-restraint systems.
 

WARNING

Use the correct size child-restraint system:
For effective protection in vehicle accidents and sudden stops, a child must be properly
restrained using a seat belt or child-restraint system depending on age and size. If not, the
child could be seriously injured or even killed in an accident.

Follow the manufacturer's instructions and always keep the child-restraint system buckled
down:
An unsecured child-restraint system is dangerous. In a sudden stop or a collision it could move
causing serious injury or death to the child or other occupants. Make sure any child-restraint
system is properly secured in place according to the child-restraint system manufacturer's
instructions. When not in use, remove it from the vehicle or fasten it with a seat belt, or latch it
down to BOTH ISOFIX anchors, and attach the corresponding tether anchor.

Child Restraint

Always secure a child in a proper child-restraint system:
Holding a child in your arms while the vehicle is moving is extremely dangerous. No matter
how strong the person may be, he or she cannot hold onto a child in a sudden stop or collision
and it could result in serious injury or death to the child or other occupants. Even in a
moderate accident, the child may be exposed to air bag forces that could result in serious
injury or death to the child, or the child may be slammed into an adult, causing injury to both
child and adult.

Extreme Hazard! Never use a rear-facing child-restraint system on the front passenger seat
with an air bag that could deploy:
NEVER use a rearward facing child restraint on a seat protected by an ACTIVE AIRBAG in front
of it, DEATH or SERIOUS INJURY to the CHILD can occur.
Vehicles with a front passenger air bag have the following warning label. The warning label
reminds you not to put a rear-facing child-restraint system on the front passenger seat at any
time.
 

(Except Taiwan)

(Taiwan)

Even in a moderate collision, the child-restraint system can be hit by a deploying air bag and
moved violently backward resulting in serious injury or death to the child.

Essential Safety Equipment

Child Restraint

(Taiwan, except front passenger seat, if equipped with the following label)
NEVER use a rearward facing child restraint on a seat protected by an ACTIVE AIRBAG in front
of it, DEATH or SERIOUS INJURY to the CHILD can occur.

Do not install a front-facing child-restraint system on the front passenger seat unless it is
unavoidable:
In a collision, the force of a deploying air bag could cause serious injury or death to the child. If
installing a front-facing child-restraint system on the front passenger seat is unavoidable,
move the front passenger seat as far back as possible and adjust the seat bottom (height
adjustable seat bottom) to the highest position at which the seat belt fastening the
child-restraint system is securely tightened.

Do not allow a child or anyone to lean over or against the side window of a vehicle with side
and curtain air bags:
It is dangerous to allow anyone to lean over or against the side window, the area of the front
passenger seat, the front and rear window pillars and the roof edge along both sides from
which the side and curtain air bags deploy, even if a child-restraint system is used. The impact
of inflation from a side or curtain air bag could cause serious injury or death to an out of
position child. Furthermore, leaning over or against the front door could block the side and
curtain air bags and eliminate the advantages of supplemental protection. With the front air
bag and the additional side air bag that comes out of the front seat, the rear seat is always a
better location for children. Take special care not to allow a child to lean over or against the
side window, even if the child is seated in a child-restraint system.

Essential Safety Equipment

Child Restraint

Never use one seat belt on more than one person at a time:
Using one seat belt for more than one person at a time is dangerous. A seat belt used in this
way cannot spread the impact forces properly and the two passengers could be crushed
together and seriously injured or even killed. Never use one belt for more than one person at a
time and always operate the vehicle with each occupant properly restrained.

Use the tether and tether anchor only for a child-restraint system:
Child-restraint system anchorages are designed to withstand only those loads imposed by
correctly installed child-restraint systems. Under no circumstances are they to be used for
adult seat belts, harnesses, or for attaching other items or equipment to the vehicle.

Always remove the head restraint and install child-restraint system (except when installing a
booster seat) (Second-row seat):
Installing a child-restraint system without removing the head restraint is dangerous. The
child-restraint system cannot be installed correctly which may result in death or injury to the
child in a collision.

CAUTION

A seat belt or child-restraint system can become very hot in a closed vehicle during warm
weather. To avoid burning yourself or a child, check them before you or your child touches
them.

NOTE
Your Mazda is equipped with ISOFIX anchors for attachment of ISOFIX child-restraint
systems on the second-row seats. When using these anchors to secure a child-restraint
system, refer to “Using ISOFIX Anchor” (page 2-41).

SRS Air Bags

Supplemental Restraint System (SRS) Precautions

The front and side supplemental restraint systems (SRS) include different types of air bags.
Please verify the different types of air bags which are equipped on your vehicle by
locating the “SRS AIRBAG” location indicators. These indicators are visible in the area
where the air bags are installed.
The air bags are installed in the following locations:
• The steering wheel hub (driver air bag)
• The front passenger dashboard (front passenger air bag)
• The outboard sides of the front seatbacks (side air bags)
• The front and rear window pillars, and the roof edge along both sides (curtain air bags)

 
Vehicles for Europe have a sensor which detects an impending roll-over accident.
 
The air bag supplemental restraint systems are designed to provide supplemental protection
in certain situations so seat belts are always important in the following ways:
 
Without seat belt usage, the air bags cannot provide adequate protection during an accident.
Seat belt usage is necessary to:
• Keep the occupant from being thrown into an inflating air bag.
• Reduce the possibility of injuries during an accident that is not designed for air bag
inflation, such as rear impact.
• Reduce the possibility of injuries in frontal, near frontal or side collisions or roll-over
accidents that are not severe enough to activate the air bags.
• Reduce the possibility of being thrown from your vehicle.
• Reduce the possibility of injuries to lower body and legs during an accident because the
air bags provide no protection to these parts of the body.
• Hold the driver in a position which allows better control of the vehicle.

 
A child who is too small to use a seat belt must be properly secured using a child-restraint
system (page 2-27).
 
Carefully consider which child-restraint system is necessary for your child and follow the
installation directions in this Owner's Manual as well as the child-restraint system
manufacturer's instructions.

Essential Safety Equipment

SRS Air Bags

WARNING

Seat belts must be worn in air bag equipped vehicles:
Depending only on the air bags for protection during an accident is dangerous. Alone, air
bags may not prevent serious injuries. The appropriate air bags can be expected to inflate
only in the first accident, such as frontal, near frontal or side collisions or roll-over accidents
that are at least moderate. Vehicle occupants should always wear seat belts.
 

Children should not ride in the front passenger seat:
Placing a child, 12 years or under, in the front seat is dangerous. The child could be hit by a
deploying air bag and be seriously injured or even killed. A sleeping child is more likely to lean
against the door and be hit by the side air bag in moderate collision to the front-passenger
side of the vehicle. Whenever possible, always secure a child 12 years and under on the rear
seats with an appropriate child-restraint system for the child's age and size.

Extreme Hazard! Never use a rear-facing child-restraint system on the front passenger seat
with an air bag that could deploy:
NEVER use a rearward facing child restraint on a seat protected by an ACTIVE AIRBAG in front
of it, DEATH or SERIOUS INJURY to the CHILD can occur.
Even in a moderate collision, the child-restraint system can be hit by a deploying air bag and
moved violently backward resulting in serious injury or death to the child.
 

Do not sit too close to the driver and front passenger air bags:
Sitting too close to the driver and front passenger air bag modules or placing hands or feet on
them is extremely dangerous. The driver and front passenger air bags inflate with great force
and speed. Serious injuries could occur if someone is too close. The driver should always hold
onto only the rim of the steering wheel. The front seat passenger should keep both feet on the
floor. Front seat occupants should adjust their seats as far back as possible and always sit
upright against the seatbacks with seat belts worn properly.

Essential Safety Equipment

SRS Air Bags

Sit in the center of the seat and wear seat belts properly:
Sitting too close to the side air bag modules or placing hands on them, or sleeping up against
the door or hanging out the windows is extremely dangerous. The side and curtain air bags
inflate with great force and speed directly expanding along the door on the side the car is hit.
Serious injury could occur if someone is sitting too close to the door or leaning against a
window, or if rear seat occupants grab the sides of the front seatbacks. Give the side and
curtain air bags room to work by sitting in the center of the seat while the vehicle is moving
with seat belts worn properly.

Do not attach objects on or around the area where driver and front passenger air bags
deploy:
Attaching an object to the driver and front passenger air bag modules or placing something
in front of them is dangerous. In an accident, an object could interfere with air bag inflation
and injure the occupants.

Do not attach objects on or around the area where a side air bag deploys:
Attaching objects to the front seat in such a way as to cover the outboard side of the seat in
any way is dangerous. In an accident the object could interfere with the side air bag, which
inflates from the outboard side of the front seats, impeding the added protection of the side
air bag system or redirecting the air bag in a way that is dangerous. Furthermore, the bag
could be cut open releasing the gas.
Do not hang net bags, map pouches or backpacks with side straps on the front seats. Never
use seat covers on the front seats. Always keep the side air bag modules in your front seats
free to deploy in the event of a side collision.

Do not attach objects on or around the area where a curtain air bag deploys:
Attaching objects to the areas where the curtain air bag activates such as on the windshield
glass, side door glass, front and rear window pillars and along the roof edge and assist grips is
dangerous. In an accident the object could interfere with the curtain air bag, which inflates
from the front and rear window pillars and along the roof edge, impeding the added
protection of the curtain air bag system or redirecting the air bag in a way that is dangerous.
Furthermore, the bag could be cut open releasing the gas.
Do not place hangers or any other objects on the assist grips. When hanging clothes, hang
them on the coat hook directly. Always keep the curtain air bag modules free to deploy in the
event of a side collision or roll-over accident.

Do not touch the components of the supplemental restraint system after the air bags have
inflated:
Touching the components of the supplemental restraint system after the air bags have
inflated is dangerous. Immediately after inflation, they are very hot. You could get burned.

Essential Safety Equipment

SRS Air Bags

Never install any front-end equipment to your vehicle:
Installation of front-end equipment, such as frontal protection bar (kangaroo bar, bull bar,
push bar, or other similar devices), snowplow, or winches, is dangerous. The air bag crash
sensor system could be affected. This could cause air bags to inflate unexpectedly, or it could
prevent the air bags from inflating during an accident. Front occupants could be seriously
injured.

Do not modify the suspension:
Modifying the vehicle suspension is dangerous. If the vehicle's height or the suspension is
modified, the vehicle will be unable to accurately detect a collision or roll-over accident
resulting in incorrect or unexpected air bag deployment and the possibility of serious injuries.

To prevent false detection by the air bag sensor system, heed the following:
Do not use tires or wheels other than those specified for your Mazda:

Use of any tire or wheel other than those specified for your Mazda (page 9-7) is
dangerous. Use of such wheels will prevent the vehicle's accident detections system from
accurately detecting a collision or roll-over accident resulting in incorrect or unexpected air
bag deployment and the possibility of serious injuries.

Do not overload your vehicle:

Overloading your vehicle is dangerous as it could prevent the air bag crash sensor system
from accurately detecting a collision or roll-over accident resulting in incorrect or
unexpected air bag deployment and the possibility of serious injuries. The gross axle weight
rating (GAWR) and the gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) for your vehicle are on the Motor
Vehicle Safety Standard Label on the driver's door frame. Do not exceed these ratings.

Do not drive the vehicle off-road:

Driving your Mazda off-road is dangerous because the vehicle has not been designed to do
so. Driving the vehicle off-road could prevent the air bag crash sensor system from
accurately detecting a collision or roll-over accident resulting in incorrect or unexpected air
bag deployment and the possibility of serious injuries.
 

Do not modify the supplemental restraint system:
Modifying the components or wiring of the supplemental restraint system is dangerous. You
could accidentally activate it or make it inoperable. Do not make any modifications to the
supplemental restraint system. This includes installing trim, badges, or anything else over the
air bag modules. It also includes installing extra electrical equipment on or near system
components or wiring. An expert repairer, we recommend an Authorized Mazda Repairer can
provide the special care needed in the removal and installation of front seats. It is important
to protect the air bag wiring and connections to assure that the bags do not accidentally
deploy and the seats retain an undamaged air bag connection.

Essential Safety Equipment

SRS Air Bags

Do not place luggage or other objects under the front seats:
Placing luggage or other objects under the front seats is dangerous. The components
essential to the supplemental restraint system could be damaged, and in the event of a side
collision, the appropriate air bags may not deploy, which could result in death or serious
injury. To prevent damage to the components essential to the supplemental restraint system,
do not place luggage or other objects under the front seats.

Do not operate a vehicle with damaged air bag/seat belt pretensioner system components:
Expended or damaged air bag/seat belt pretensioner system components must be replaced
after any collision which caused them to deploy or damage them. Only a trained expert
repairer, we recommend an Authorized Mazda Repairer can fully evaluate these systems to
see that they will work in any subsequent accident. Driving with an expended or damaged air
bag or pretensioner unit will not afford you the necessary protection in the event of any
subsequent accident which could result in serious injury or death.

Do not remove interior air bag parts:
Removing any components such as the front seats, front dashboard, the steering wheel or
parts on the front and rear window pillars and along the roof edge, containing air bag parts
or sensors is dangerous. These parts contain essential air bag components. The air bag could
accidentally activate and cause serious injuries. Always have an Authorized Mazda Repairer
remove these parts.

Properly dispose of the air bag system:
Improper disposal of an air bag or a vehicle with live air bags in it can be extremely
dangerous. Unless all safety procedures are followed, injury could result. Have an expert
repairer, we recommend an Authorized Mazda Repairer safely dispose of the air bag system
or scrap an air bag equipped vehicle.

NOTE
• When an air bag deploys, a loud inflation noise can be heard and some smoke will be
released. Neither is likely to cause injury, however, the texture of the air bags may cause
light skin injuries on body parts not covered with clothing through friction.
• Should you sell your Mazda, we urge you to tell the new owner of its air bag systems and
that familiarization with all instructions about them, from the Owner's Manual, is
important.

How the SRS Air Bags Work

Your Mazda is equipped with the following types of SRS air bags. SRS air bags are
designed to work together with the seat belts to help to reduce injuries during an accident.
The SRS air bags are designed to provide further protection for passengers in addition to the
seat belt functions. Be sure to wear seat belts properly.
▼ Front Seat Belt Pretensioners
The front seat belt pretensioners are designed to deploy in moderate or severe frontal, near
frontal collisions.
In addition, the pretensioners operate when a side collision (only on the side in which the
collision occurs) or a roll-over accident is detected. The pretensioners operate differently
depending on what types of air bags are equipped. For more details about seat belt
pretensioner operation, refer to the SRS Air Bag Deployment Criteria (page 2-55).
▼ Driver Air Bag
The driver's air bag is mounted in the steering wheel.
When air bag crash sensors detect a frontal impact of greater than moderate force, the
driver's air bag inflates quickly helping to reduce injury mainly to the driver's head or chest
caused by directly hitting the steering wheel.
For more details about air bag deployment, refer to "SRS Air Bag Deployment Criteria"
(page 2-55).

Essential Safety Equipment

SRS Air Bags

▼ Front Passenger Air Bag
The front passenger air bag is mounted in the front passenger dashboard.
The inflation mechanism for the front passenger air bag is the same as the driver's air bag.
For more details about air bag deployment, refer to "SRS Air Bag Deployment Criteria"
(page 2-55).

▼ Side Air Bags
The side air bags are mounted in the outboard sides of the front seatbacks.
When the air bag crash sensors detect a side impact of greater than moderate force, the
system inflates the side air bag only on the side in which the vehicle was hit. The side air
bag inflates quickly to reduce injury to the driver or front passenger's chest caused by
directly hitting interior parts such as a door or window.
For more details about air bag deployment, refer to "SRS Air Bag Deployment Criteria"
(page 2-55).

Essential Safety Equipment

SRS Air Bags

▼ Curtain Air Bags
The curtain air bags are mounted in the front and rear window pillars, and the roof edge
along both sides.
When the air bag crash sensors detect a side impact of greater than moderate force, the
curtain air bag inflates quickly and helps to reduce injury mainly to the rear outboard
passenger's head caused by directly hitting interior parts such as a door or window.
For more details about air bag deployment, refer to "SRS Air Bag Deployment Criteria"
(page 2-55).
In a side impact:
Greater than moderate impact to one side of the vehicle will cause the curtain air bag on that
side only to inflate.
 

Only one side curtain air bag will deploy on the 
side of the vehicle that receives the force of an 
impact.

(European models)
In a roll-over:
In response to a vehicle roll-over, both curtain air bags inflate.
 

Both curtain air bags will deploy after 
the roll-over accident is detected.

After closing the doors and the liftgate,
always verify that they are securely closed:
Doors and the liftgate not securely closed
are dangerous, if the vehicle is driven with
a door and the liftgate not securely closed,
the door and the liftgate could open
unexpectedly resulting in an accident.

Always confirm the safety around the
vehicle before opening a door and the
liftgate:
Suddenly opening a door and the liftgate is
dangerous. A passing vehicle or a
pedestrian could be hit and cause an
accident.

CAUTION

Always confirm the conditions around
the vehicle before opening/closing the
doors and the liftgate and use caution
during strong winds or when parked on
an incline. Not being aware of the
conditions around the vehicle is
dangerous because fingers could get
caught in the door and the liftgate or a
passing pedestrian could be hit, resulting
in an unexpected accident or injury.

WARNING

Always take all children and pets with you
or leave a responsible person with them:
Leaving a child or a pet unattended in a
parked vehicle is dangerous. In hot
weather, temperatures inside a vehicle can
become high enough to cause brain
damage or even death.

Do not leave the key in your vehicle with
children and keep them in a place where
your children will not find or play with
them:
Leaving children in a vehicle with the key is
dangerous. This could result in someone
being badly injured or even killed.

Keep all doors locked when driving:
Unlocked doors in a moving vehicle are
dangerous. Passengers can fall out if a
door is accidentally opened and can more
easily be thrown out in an accident.

Always close all the windows and sunroof,
lock the doors and the liftgate and take the
key with you when leaving your vehicle
unattended:
Leaving your vehicle unlocked is dangerous
as children could lock themselves in a hot
vehicle, which could result in death. Also, a
vehicle left unlocked becomes an easy
target for thieves and intruders.

WARNING

Never allow a person to ride in the luggage
compartment:
Allowing a person to ride in the luggage
compartment is dangerous. The person in
the luggage compartment could be
seriously injured or killed during sudden
braking or a collision.

Do not drive with the liftgate open:
Exhaust gas in the cabin of a vehicle is
dangerous. An open liftgate in a moving
vehicle will cause exhaust gas to be drawn
into the cabin. This gas contains CO
(carbon monoxide), which is colorless,
odorless, and highly poisonous, and it can
cause loss of consciousness and death.
Moreover, an open liftgate could cause
occupants to fall out in an accident.

Do not stack or leave loaded luggage
unsecured in the luggage compartment:
Otherwise, the luggage may move or
collapse, resulting in injury or an accident.
In addition, do not load luggage higher
than the seatbacks. It may affect the side or
rear field of view.

CAUTION

Before opening the liftgate, remove any

snow and ice accumulation on it.
Otherwise, the liftgate could close under
the weight of the snow and ice resulting
in injury.

automatically from the near-shut position,
which could cause hands and fingers to be
pinched and injured.

NOTE
• If the electric liftgate opener is pressed
while the easy closure function is
operating, the liftgate can be opened.
• If the liftgate is opened/closed
repeatedly in a short period of time, the
easy closure function may not operate.
Wait for about 2 seconds and then try
again.

CAUTION

Sensors are installed on both ends of the
power liftgate. Be careful not to allow the
sensors to be scratched or damaged by
sharp objects, otherwise the liftgate may
no longer open/close automatically. In
addition, if the sensor is damaged while the
liftgate is closing automatically, the system
will stop.

NOTE
The jam-safe equipment does not activate
during easy closure operation when the
power liftgate is between the near-shut
position and fully closed position.
When the power liftgate is moving in the
open/close direction and an obstruction is
detected, the beep sound will be heard and
the liftgate moves in the reverse direction
and stops.

Fuel with a lower rating will negatively affect the emission control system performance and
could also cause engine knocking and serious engine damage.
 

CAUTION

USE ONLY UNLEADED FUEL.

Leaded fuel is harmful to the catalytic converter and oxygen sensors and will lead to
deterioration of the emission control system and or failures.

The use of E10 fuel with 10 % ethanol is safe for your vehicle. Damage to your vehicle may

occur when ethanol exceeds this recommendation.

Never add fuel system additives, otherwise the emission control system could be damaged.

Fuel and Emission

▼ Emission Control System
This vehicle is equipped with an emission control system (the catalytic converter is part of
this system) that enables the vehicle to comply with existing exhaust emissions
requirements.

Never park over or near anything flammable:
Parking over or near anything flammable, such as dry grass, is dangerous. Even with the
engine turned off, the exhaust system remains very hot after normal use and could ignite
anything flammable. A resulting fire could cause serious injury or death.

WARNING

CAUTION

Ignoring the following precautions could cause lead to accumulate on the catalyst inside the
converter or cause the converter to get very hot. Either condition will damage the converter
and cause poor performance.
USE ONLY UNLEADED FUEL.
Do not drive your Mazda with any sign of engine malfunction.
Do not coast with the ignition switched off.
Do not descend steep grades in gear with the ignition switched off.
Do not operate the engine at high idle for more than 2 minutes.
Do not tamper with the emission control system. All inspections and adjustments must be

made by a qualified technician.

Do not push-start or pull-start this vehicle.

Fuel and Emission

▼ Engine Exhaust (Carbon monoxide)

WARNING

Do not drive your vehicle if you smell exhaust gas inside the vehicle:
Engine exhaust gas is dangerous. This gas contains carbon monoxide (CO), which is colorless,
odorless, and poisonous. When inhaled, it can cause loss of consciousness and death. If you
smell exhaust gas inside the vehicle, keep all windows fully open and contact an expert
repairer, we recommend an Authorized Mazda Repairer immediately.

Do not run the engine when inside an enclosed area:
Running the engine inside an enclosed area, such as a garage, is dangerous. Exhaust gas,
which contains poisonous carbon monoxide, could easily enter the cabin. Loss of
consciousness or even death could occur.

Open the windows or adjust the heating or cooling system to draw fresh air when idling the
engine:
Exhaust gas is dangerous. When the vehicle is stopped with the windows closed and the
engine running for a long time even in an open area, exhaust gas, which contains poisonous
carbon monoxide, could enter the cabin. Loss of consciousness or even death could occur.

Clear snow from underneath and around your vehicle, particularly the tail pipe, before
starting the engine:
Running the engine when a vehicle is stopped in deep snow is dangerous. The exhaust pipe
could be blocked by the snow, allowing exhaust gas to enter the cabin. Because exhaust gas
contains poisonous carbon monoxide, it could cause loss of consciousness or even death to
occupants in the cabin.

Fuel-Filler Lid and Cap

CAUTION

Before Driving

Fuel and Emission

Always use only a designated Mazda
fuel-filler cap or an approved equivalent,
available at an expert repairer, we
recommend an Authorized Mazda
Repairer. The wrong cap can result in a
serious malfunction of the fuel and
emission control systems.
▼ Fuel-Filler Lid

release.
To close, press the fuel-filler lid until it
locks securely.

Remote fuel-filler lid release

WARNING

When removing the fuel-filler cap, loosen
the cap slightly and wait for any hissing to
stop, then remove it:
Fuel spray is dangerous. Fuel can burn skin
and eyes and cause illness if ingested. Fuel
spray is released when there is pressure in
the fuel tank and the fuel-filler cap is
removed too quickly.

Before refueling, stop the engine, and
always keep sparks and flames away from
the filler neck:
Fuel vapor is dangerous. It could be ignited
by sparks or flames causing serious burns
and injuries.
Additionally, use of the incorrect fuel-filler
cap or not using a fuel-filler cap may result
in a fuel leak, which could result in serious
burns or death in an accident.

Do not continue refueling after the fuel
pump nozzle shuts off automatically:
Continuing to add fuel after the fuel pump
nozzle has shut off automatically is
dangerous because overfilling the fuel tank
may cause fuel overflow or leakage. Fuel
overflow and leakage could damage the
vehicle and if the fuel ignites it could cause
a fire and explosion resulting in serious
injury or death.

if the system has been modified or if any
add-on equipment has been installed.

CAUTION

To avoid damage to the vehicle, do not
modify the system or install any add-on
equipment to the immobilizer and the
theft-deterrent systems or the vehicle.

The immobilizer system allows the engine
to start only with a key the system
recognizes.
 
If someone attempts to start the engine
with an unrecognized key, the engine will
not start, thereby helping to prevent
vehicle theft.
If you have a problem with the
immobilizer system or the key, consult an
Authorized Mazda Repairer.

CAUTION

Changes or modifications not expressly

approved by the party responsible for
compliance could void the user's
authority to operate the equipment.
To avoid damage to the key, do not:

Drop the key.
Get the key wet.
Expose the key to any kind of magnetic

field.

Expose the key to high temperatures
on places such as the dashboard or
hood, under direct sunlight.

If the engine does not start with the

correct key, and the security indicator
light keeps illuminating or flashing, the
system may have a malfunction. Consult
an Authorized Mazda Repairer.

NOTE
• The keys carry a unique electronic code.
For this reason, and to assure your
safety, obtaining a replacement key
requires some waiting time. They are
only available through an Authorized
Mazda Repairer.

Disarming
The system is disarmed when the ignition
is switched ON with the correct
programmed key. The security indicator
light illuminates for about 3 seconds and
then turns off. If the engine does not start
with the correct key, and the security
indicator light remains illuminated or
flashing, try the following:
Make sure the key is within the
operational range for signal transmission.
Switch the ignition off, and then restart the
engine. If the engine does not start after 3
or more tries, contact an Authorized
Mazda Repairer.
NOTE
• If the security indicator light flashes
continuously while you are driving, do
not shut off the engine. Go to an
Authorized Mazda Repairer and have it
checked. If the engine is shut off while
the indicator light is flashing, you will
not be able to restart it.
• Because the electronic codes are reset
when the immobilizer system is repaired,
the keys are needed. Make sure to bring
all the keys to an Authorized Mazda
Repairer so that they can be
programmed.

• Always keep a spare key in case one is
lost. If a key is lost, consult an
Authorized Mazda Repairer as soon as
possible.
• If you lose a key, an Authorized Mazda
Repairer will reset the electronic codes
of your remaining keys and immobilizer
system. Bring all the remaining keys to
an Authorized Mazda Repairer to reset.
Starting the vehicle with a key that has
not been reset is not possible.

▼ Operation

NOTE
• The engine may not start and security
indicator light may illuminate or flash if
the key is placed in an area where it is
difficult for the system to detect the
signal, such as on the dashboard or in
the glove compartment. Move the key to
a location within the signal range,
switch the ignition off, and then restart
the engine.
• Signals from a TV or radio station, or
from a transceiver or mobile telephone
could interfere with your immobilizer
system. If you are using the proper key
and the engine fails to start, check the
security indicator light.

Arming
The system is armed when the ignition is
switched from ON to off.
The security indicator light in the

Before Driving

Security System

Theft-Deterrent System*
If the theft-deterrent system detects an
inappropriate entry into the vehicle or the
intrusion sensor detects movement in the
vehicle which could result in the vehicle
(with the intrusion sensor) or its contents
being stolen, the alarm alerts the
surrounding area of an abnormality by
sounding the siren/horn and flashing the
hazard warning lights.
 
The system will not function unless it's
properly armed. So when you leave the
vehicle, follow the arming procedure
correctly.
Intrusion sensor*
The intrusion sensor uses ultrasonic waves
to detect movement inside the vehicle and
to raise an alert of an intrusion into the
vehicle.
 
The intrusion sensor detects certain kinds
of movement inside the vehicle, however,
it may also respond to phenomenon
outside the vehicle such as vibrations, loud
noise, wind, and air currents.

CAUTION

In order for the intrusion sensor to operate
appropriately, be aware of the following:
Do not hang clothing or objects from a

Driving Tips

Break-In Period

No special break-in is necessary, but a few
precautions in the first 1,000 km (600
miles) may add to the performance,
economy, and life of the vehicle.
• Do not race the engine.
• Do not maintain one constant speed,
either slow or fast, for a long period of
time.
• Do not drive constantly at full-throttle or
high engine rpm for extended periods of
time.
• Avoid unnecessary hard stops.
• Avoid full-throttle starts.
• Do not tow a trailer.

Saving Fuel and Protection

of the Environment

How you operate your Mazda determines
how far it will travel on a tank of fuel. Use
these suggestions to help save fuel and
reduce CO2.
• Avoid long warm-ups. Once the engine
runs smoothly, begin driving.
• Avoid fast starts.
• Drive at lower speeds.
• Anticipate when to apply the brakes
(avoid sudden braking).
• Follow the maintenance schedule (page
6-3) and have an expert repairer, we
recommend an Authorized Mazda
Repairer perform inspections and
servicing.
• Use the air conditioner only when
necessary.
• Slow down on rough roads.
• Keep the tires properly inflated.
• Do not carry unnecessary weight.
• Do not rest your foot on the brake pedal
while driving.
• Keep the wheels in correct alignment.
• Keep windows closed at high speeds.
• Slow down when driving in crosswinds
and headwinds.

WARNING

Never stop the engine when going down a
hill:
Stopping the engine when going down a
hill is dangerous. This causes the loss of
power steering and power brake control,
and may cause damage to the drivetrain.
Any loss of steering or braking control
could cause an accident.

Driving Tips

When driving on ice or in water, snow,
mud, sand, or similar hazards:
• Be cautious and allow extra distance for
braking.
• Avoid sudden braking and sudden
maneuvering.
• Do not pump the brakes. Continue to
press down on the brake pedal.
Refer to Antilock Brake System (ABS)
on page 4-72.
• If you get stuck, select a lower gear and
accelerate slowly. Do not spin the front
wheels.
• For more traction in starting on slippery
surfaces such as ice or packed snow, use
sand, rock salt, chains, carpeting, or
other nonslip material under the front
wheels.

NOTE
Use snow chains only on the front wheels.

Hazardous Driving

WARNING

Be extremely careful if it is necessary to
downshift on slippery surfaces:
Downshifting into lower gear while driving
on slippery surfaces is dangerous. The
sudden change in tire speed could cause
the tires to skid. This could lead to loss of
vehicle control and an accident.

Avoid sharp turns, excessive speed and
abrupt maneuvers when driving this
vehicle:
Sharp turns, excessive speed and abrupt
maneuvering of this vehicle are dangerous
as it could result in the increased risk of loss
of vehicle control, vehicle roll-over,
personal injury or death.
This vehicle has a higher center of gravity.
Vehicles with a higher center of gravity
such as utility vehicles handle differently
than vehicles with a lower center of gravity.
Utility vehicles are not designed for
cornering at high speeds any more than
low profile sports cars are designed to
perform satisfactorily under off-road
conditions.
In addition, utility vehicles have a
significantly higher rollover rate than other
types of vehicles.
In a rollover crash, an unbelted person is
significantly more likely to die than a
person wearing a seat belt.

Driving Tips

Floor Mat

We recommend the use of Genuine
Mazda floor mats.
WARNING

Make sure the floor mats are secured with
the grommets or the retainers to prevent
them from bunching up under the foot
pedals (Driver's side):
Using a floor mat that is not secured is
dangerous as it will interfere with the
accelerator and brake pedal operation
(driver's side), which could result in an
accident.
Only use a floor mat which conforms to the
shape of the floor on the driver's side and
make sure it is oriented correctly.
Secure the floor mat using the grommets or
retainers.
There are various ways to secure floor mats
depending on the type used, therefore
secure the mat according to the type.
After installing the floor mat, make sure
that it does not slide from side to side or
back and forth, and that there is sufficient
clearance with the accelerator and brake
pedals on the driver's side.
After removing the floor mat for cleaning
or some other reason, always securely
reinstall it while paying attention to the
precautions just mentioned.

Do not install two floor mats, one on top of
the other, on the driver's side:
Installing two floor mats, one on top of the
other, on the driver's side is dangerous as
the retention pins can only keep one floor
mat from sliding forward.
Loose floor mat(s) will interfere with the
foot pedals and could result in an accident.
If using an all-weather mat for winter use
always remove the original floor mat.

When setting a floor mat, position the
floor mat so that its grommets or retainers
are inserted over the pointed end of the
retention posts.

Towing a trailer without using a safety chain securely attached to both the trailer and the
vehicle is dangerous. If damage occurs to the coupling unit or hitch ball, the trailer could
wander into another lane and cause a collision.
▼ Trailer Lights

WARNING

CAUTION

Do not connect a trailer lighting system directly to the lighting system of your Mazda. This
may damage your vehicle's electrical system and lighting systems. To connect the lighting
system, consult an Authorized Mazda Dealer.
▼ Trailer Brakes
Check the Maximum trailer towing-load table in Weight Limits (page 3-56), and if your
trailer weight exceeds the value in the TOTAL TRAILER WEIGHT (Trailer without brake),
trailer brakes are required.
If your trailer has brakes, make sure they meet regulations.

WARNING

Do not connect a hydraulic trailer-brake system to your vehicle's brake system:
Connecting a hydraulic trailer-brake system directly to the vehicle brake system is dangerous
and will result in inadequate braking and possible injury.
▼ Trailer Towing Tips
Before driving
• Verify that your Mazda maintains a near-normal attitude when a loaded or unloaded trailer
is connected. Do not drive if it has an abnormal front-up or front-down position. Inspect
for incorrect tongue load, worn suspension parts, and trailer overloading. Have the vehicle
inspected by an expert repairer, we recommend an Authorized Mazda Repairer.
• Make sure the trailer cargo is secure to prevent it from shifting.
• Make sure the mirrors meet all government regulations. Inspect them.
• Before starting out, inspect the operation of all vehicle and trailer lights and all
vehicle-to-trailer connections. Stop and re-inspect all lights and connections after driving
a short distance.

CX-9_8GC7-EE-17G_Edition1

2017-5-16 8:22:04

Before Driving

Towing

Driving
• Your Mazda will handle differently with a trailer in tow, so practice turning, backing, and
stopping in a traffic-free area.
• Take time to get accustomed to the extra weight and length.
• Do not exceed 100 km/h (62 mph) with a trailer in tow. If the local legal maximum speed
with a trailer in tow is less than 100 km/h (62 mph), do not exceed the legal speed.

CAUTION

If the vehicle exceeds 100 km/h (62 mph) with a trailer in tow, the vehicle could be
damaged.
• When ascending a hill, shift into a lower gear to reduce the possibility of overloading or
overheating the engine, or both.
• When descending a hill, shift into a lower gear and use engine compression as a braking
effect. Pay constant attention to speed and use the brakes only as needed. Holding the
brake pedal down for a prolonged period may cause the brakes to overheat and lose
power.
Parking
Avoid parking on an incline with a trailer. If this must be done, follow these instructions.
Parking on an Incline
1. Set the parking brake and the brakes.
2. Have someone block the wheels of the vehicle and trailer while you apply the brakes.
3. After the wheels are blocked, release the parking brake and the brakes slowly, allowing

the blocks to bear the load.

4. Set the parking brake firmly.
5.

If the vehicle has an automatic transaxle, put the selector lever in P. If it has a manual
transaxle, place the gear shift in 1 or R.

Starting on an Incline
1. Start the engine (page 4-5).
2. Release the parking brake and slowly pull away a short distance from the wheel blocks.
3. Stop on the nearest level ground, set the parking brake, and pick up the wheel blocks.

Automatic Transaxle

When Driving

NOTE
(With parking sensor system)
When the selector lever is shifted to the R
position with the ignition switched ON, the
parking sensor system is activated and a
beep sound is heard.
Refer to Parking Sensor System on page
4-191.
N (Neutral)
In N, the wheels and transaxle are not
locked. The vehicle will roll freely even
on the slightest incline unless the parking
brake or brakes are on.
WARNING

If the engine is running faster than idle, do
not shift from N or P into a driving gear:
It's dangerous to shift from N or P into a
driving gear when the engine is running
faster than idle. If this is done, the vehicle
could move suddenly, causing an accident
or serious injury.

Do not shift into N when driving the
vehicle:
Shifting into N while driving is dangerous.
Engine braking cannot be applied when
decelerating which could lead to an
accident or serious injury.

CAUTION

Do not shift into N when driving the
vehicle. Doing so can cause transaxle
damage.

▼ Active Adaptive Shift (AAS)
Active Adaptive Shift (AAS)
automatically controls the transaxle shift
points to best suit the road conditions and
driver input. This improves driving feel.
The transaxle may switch to AAS mode
when driving up and down slopes,
cornering, driving at high elevations, or
depressing the accelerator pedal quickly
while the selector lever is in the D
position. Depending on the road and
driving conditions/vehicle operations, gear
shifting could be delayed or not occur,
however, this does not indicate a problem
because the AAS mode will maintain the
optimum gear position.

When Driving

Automatic Transaxle

NOTE
Apply the parking brake or depress the
brake pedal before moving the selector
lever from N to prevent the vehicle from
moving unexpectedly.
D (Drive)
D is the normal driving position. From a

Manual Shift Mode

The manual shift mode gives you the feel
of driving a manual transaxle vehicle by
allowing you to operate the selector lever
manually. This allows you to control
engine rpm and torque to the drive wheels
much like a manual transaxle when more
control is desired.
To change to manual shift mode, shift the
lever from D to M.
 

NOTE
Changing to manual shift mode while
driving will not damage the transaxle.
To return to automatic shift mode, shift the
lever from M to D.
NOTE
• If you change to manual shift mode
when the vehicle is stopped, the gear
will shift to M1.
• If you change to manual shift mode
without depressing the accelerator pedal
when driving in D range, 5th gear/6th
gear, the gear will shift to M4/M5.

NOTE
• If the gears cannot be shifted down
when driving at higher speeds, the gear
position indication will flash twice to
signal that the gears cannot be shifted
down (to protect the transaxle).
• If the automatic transaxle fluid (ATF)
temperature becomes too high, there is
the possibility that the transaxle will
switch to automatic shift mode,
canceling manual shift mode and
turning off the gear position indication
illumination. This is a normal function
to protect the AT. After the ATF
temperature has decreased, the gear
position indication illumination turns
back on and driving in manual shift

 once.

▼ Manually Shifting Down
You can shift gears down by operating the
selector lever.
M6 → M5 → M4 → M3 → M2→ M1
To shift down to a lower gear, tap the
selector lever forward 
 

 once.

NOTE
• When driving slowly, the gears may not
shift up.
• Do not drive the vehicle with the
tachometer needle in the RED ZONE
while in manual shift mode. In addition,
manual shift mode switches to automatic
shift mode while the accelerator pedal is
completely depressed.
This function is canceled while the TCS
is turned off. However, if the vehicle is
continuously driven at a high rpm, the
gears may automatically shift up to
protect the engine.

WARNING

Do not use engine braking on slippery road
surfaces or at high speeds:
Shifting down while driving on wet, snowy,
or frozen roads, or while driving at high
speeds causes sudden engine braking,
which is dangerous. The sudden change in
tire speed could cause the tires to skid. This
could lead to loss of vehicle control and an
accident.

Climbing steep grades from a stop
To climb a steep grade from a stopped
position:
1. Depress the brake pedal.
2. Shift to D or M1, depending on the

load weight and grade steepness.

3. Release the brake pedal while

gradually accelerating.
Descending steep grades
When descending a steep grade, shift to
lower gears, depending on load weight and
grade steepness. Descend slowly, using the
brakes only occasionally to prevent them
from overheating.

Driving Tips

WARNING

Do not let the vehicle move in a direction
opposite to the direction selected by the
selector lever:
Do not let the vehicle move backward with
the selector lever in a forward position, or
do not let the vehicle move forward with
the selector lever in the reverse position.
Otherwise, the engine may stop, causing
the loss of the power brake and power
steering functions, and make it difficult to
control the vehicle which could result in an
accident.
Passing
For extra power when passing another
vehicle or climbing steep grades, depress
the accelerator fully. The transaxle will
shift to a lower gear, depending on vehicle
speed.
NOTE
• The accelerator pedal may initially feel
heavy as it is being depressed, then feel
lighter as it is depressed further. This
change in pedal force aids the engine
control system in determining how much
the accelerator pedal has been
depressed for performing kickdown, and
functions to control whether or not
kickdown should be performed.
• While the selector lever is in the M
position and the TCS is turned off,
manual shift mode does not switch to
automatic shift mode even if the
accelerator pedal is completely
depressed. Operate the selector lever.

Dry off brakes that have become wet by
driving slowly, releasing the accelerator
pedal and lightly applying the brakes
several times until the brake performance
returns to normal:
Driving with wet brakes is dangerous.
Increased stopping distance or the vehicle
pulling to one side when braking could
result in a serious accident. Light braking
will indicate whether the brakes have been
affected.

CAUTION

Do not drive with your foot held on the
brake pedal. Doing so could result in the
following:
The brake parts will wear out more

quickly.

The brakes can overheat and adversely

affect brake performance.

Always depress the brake pedal with the

Brake System

▼ Foot Brake
This vehicle has power-assisted brakes
that adjust automatically through normal
use.
 
Should power-assist fail, you can stop by
applying greater force than normal to the
brake pedal. But the distance required to
stop will be greater than usual.

WARNING

Do not coast with the engine stalled or
turned off, find a safe place to stop:
Coasting with the engine stalled or turned
off is dangerous. Braking will require more
effort, and the brake's power-assist could
be depleted if you pump the brake. This will
cause longer stopping distances or even an
accident.

Shift to a lower gear when going down
steep hills:
Driving with your foot continuously on the
brake pedal or steadily applying the brakes
for long distances is dangerous. This causes
overheated brakes, resulting in longer
stopping distances or even total brake
failure. This could cause loss of vehicle
control and a serious accident. Avoid
continuous application of the brakes.

▼ Brake Assist
During emergency braking situations
when it is necessary to depress the brake
pedal with greater force, the brake assist
system provides braking assistance, thus
enhancing braking performance.
 
When the brake pedal is depressed hard or
depressed more quickly, the brakes apply
more firmly.
NOTE
• When the brake pedal is depressed hard
or depressed more quickly, the pedal
will feel softer but the brakes will apply
more firmly. This is a normal effect of
the brake assist operation and does not
indicate a malfunction.
• When the brake pedal is depressed hard
or depressed more quickly, a motor/
pump operation noise may be heard.
This is a normal effect of the brake
assist and does not indicate a
malfunction.
• The brake assist equipment does not
supersede the functionality of the
vehicle's main braking system.

Emergency Stop Signal

System

Your Mazda is equipped with an
emergency stop signal system that is
designed to determine whether you are
depressing the brake pedal with greater
force than during normal braking such as
in a situation requiring emergency
braking. If the system determines that such
a situation is occurring, it flashes all the
turn signals rapidly to caution the driver of
the vehicle following behind your vehicle
of the sudden braking situation.
The system turns off when it determines
that the brake pedal is released or that an
emergency braking situation no longer
exists based on the reduced vehicle speed.
NOTE
• If you bring your vehicle to a complete
stop while all the turn signals are
flashing rapidly, the rapid flashing of all
the turn signals changes back to the
normal flashing pattern.
• The emergency stop signal system does
not operate at vehicle speeds under
about 60 km/h (37 mph).
• If the brake pedal is depressed while
driving on slippery roads, the
emergency stop signal system could
operate causing all the turn and lane
change signals to flash.

Refer to Warning/Indicator Lights on
page 4-32.
• HLA does not turn off even if the TCS
OFF switch is pressed to turn off the
TCS.

Hill Launch Assist (HLA)
HLAis a function which assists the driver
in accelerating from a stop while on a
slope. When the driver releases the brake
pedal and depresses the accelerator pedal
while on a slope, the function prevents the
vehicle from rolling. The braking force is
maintained automatically after the brake
pedal is released on a steep grade.
HLAoperates on a downward slope when
the selector lever is in the reverse (R)
position, and on an upward slope when the
selector lever is in a forward gear.

WARNING

Do not rely completely on HLA:
HLA is an auxiliary device for accelerating
from a stop on a slope. The system only
operates for about two seconds and
therefore, relying only on the system, when
accelerating from a stop is dangerous
because the vehicle may move (roll)
unexpectedly and cause an accident.
The vehicle could roll depending on the
vehicle's load or if it is towing something.
Always confirm the safety around the
vehicle before starting to drive the vehicle.

NOTE
• HLA does not operate on a gentle slope.
In addition, the gradient of the slope on
which the system will operate changes
depending on the vehicle's load.
• HLA does not operate if the parking
brake is applied, or if the vehicle has not
stopped completely.
• HLA is operating, the brake pedal may
feel stiff and vibrate, however, this does
not indicate a malfunction.

ABS/TCS/DSC/Trailer Stability Assist (TSA)

NOTE
• Braking distances may be longer on
loose surfaces (snow or gravel, for
example) which usually have a hard
foundation. A vehicle with a normal
braking system may require less
distance to stop under these conditions
because the tires will build up a wedge
of surface layer when the wheels skid.
• The sound of the ABS operating may be
heard when starting the engine or
immediately after starting the vehicle,
however, it does not indicate a
malfunction.

Antilock Brake System

(ABS)

The ABS control unit continuously
monitors the speed of each wheel. If one
wheel is about to lock up, the ABS
responds by automatically releasing and
reapplying that wheel's brake.
 
The driver will feel a slight vibration in
the brake pedal and may hear a chattering
noise from the brake system. This is
normal ABS system operation. Continue
to depress the brake pedal without
pumping the brakes.
 
The warning light turns on when the
system has a malfunction.
Refer to Warning Indication/Warning
Lights on page 4-33.
WARNING

Do not rely on ABS as a substitute for safe
driving:
The ABS cannot compensate for unsafe
and reckless driving, excessive speed,
tailgating (following another vehicle too
closely), driving on ice and snow, and
hydroplaning (reduced tire friction and
road contact because of water on the road
surface). You can still have an accident.

Traction Control System

(TCS)

The Traction Control System (TCS)
enhances traction and safety by controlling
engine torque and braking. When the TCS
detects driving wheel slippage, it lowers
engine torque and operates the brakes to
prevent loss of traction.
 
This means that on a slick surface, the
engine adjusts automatically to provide
optimum power to the drive wheels,
limiting wheel spin and loss of traction.
 
The warning light turns on when the
system has a malfunction.

Adaptive LED Headlights (ALH)*

The ALH are a system which uses the Forward Sensing Camera (FSC) to determine the
situation of a vehicle ahead or a vehicle approaching in the opposite direction while driving
at night to automatically switch the illumination range of the headlights, the illuminated
area, or the illumination brightness.
Refer to Forward Sensing Camera (FSC) on page 4-159.
The ALH are controlled between high and low beams as follows to assure the driver’s
visibility without dazzling a vehicle ahead or a vehicle approaching in the opposite
direction.
Glare-Free High Beam
This feature dims only the high-beam light shone on the vehicle ahead.
The high beams will dim while driving at a speed of about 40 km/h (25 mph) or faster.
When the vehicle speed is less than about 30 km/h (18 mph), the beams switch to the low
beams.

Blind Spot Monitoring (BSM)*

The BSM is designed to assist the driver in checking the area to the rear of the vehicle on
both sides during lane changes by notifying the driver of the presence of vehicles
approaching from the rear in an adjacent lane.
The BSM detects vehicles approaching from the rear while traveling in the forward
direction at a speed of 30 km/h (19 mph) or faster and notifies the driver by turning on the
BSM warning indicator light and displaying the vehicle detection screen (vehicles with
multi-information display and active driving display).
If the turn signal lever is operated to signal a turn in the direction in which the BSM
warning indicator light is illuminated while the approaching vehicle is detected, the BSM
notifies the driver of possible danger by turning on the BSM warning indicator light, and by
activating the warning sound and the warning screen indicator display (vehicles with
multi-information display and active driving display).
The detection area on this system covers the driving lanes on both sides of the vehicle and
from the rear part of the front doors to about 50 m (164 ft) behind the vehicle.

Distance Recognition Support System (DRSS)*

The DRSS measures the distance between your vehicle and a vehicle ahead using a radar
sensor (front) while the vehicle speed is about 30 km/h (19 mph) or faster, and if your
vehicle approaches a vehicle ahead more closely than what is appropriate for maintaining
distance between the vehicles according to the vehicle speed, a notification in the active
driving display is indicated to advise you to keep a safe distance from the vehicle ahead.

WARNING

Do not rely completely on the DRSS and always drive carefully:
The ability to detect a vehicle ahead is limited depending on the type of vehicle ahead, the
weather conditions, and the traffic conditions. Therefore, if the accelerator and brake pedals
are not operated correctly it could lead to an accident. Always verify the safety of the
surrounding area and depress the brake pedal or accelerator pedal while keeping a safer
distance from vehicles ahead or on-coming vehicles.

NOTE
• The DRSS operates when all of the following conditions are met:

• The ignition is switched ON.
• The DRSS is on.
• The selector lever is in a position other than reverse (R).
• The vehicle speed is 30 km/h or faster (19 mph or faster).

• The objects which activate the system are 4-wheeled vehicles.
• The DRSS may also operate in the presence of motorcycles and bicycles.
• The DRSS may not operate normally under the following conditions:

• The Dynamic Stability Control (DSC) has a malfunction.
• The vehicle ahead is traveling at an extremely slow speed.

• The system does not operate with the following objects:

• Vehicles approaching in the opposite direction.
• Stationary objects (stopped vehicles, obstructions)

Driver Attention Alert (DAA)*

The DAA is a system which detects driver fatigue and decreased attentiveness, and
encourages the driver to take a rest.
When the vehicle is driven inside traffic lane lines at about 65 to 140 km/h (41 to 86 mph),
the DAA estimates the amount of accumulated fatigue and decreased attentiveness of the
driver based on the information from the Forward Sensing Camera (FSC) and other vehicle
information, and encourages the driver to take a rest using an indication on the
multi-information display and a warning sound.
Use the DAA on expressways or highways.
Refer to Forward Sensing Camera (FSC) on page 4-159.

WARNING

Do not rely completely on DAA and always drive carefully:
The DAA detects driver fatigue and decreased attentiveness and encourages the driver to take
a rest, however, it is not designed to prevent the vehicle from straying. If you rely too much on
the DAA it could lead to an accident. Drive carefully and operate the steering wheel
appropriately.
In addition, the system may not be able to detect driver fatigue and decreased attentiveness
correctly depending on the traffic and driving conditions. The driver must take sufficient rest
in consideration of safer driving.

NOTE
• The DAA operates when all of the following conditions are met.

Mazda Radar Cruise Control (MRCC)*

The MRCC system is designed to maintain headway control*1 with a vehicle ahead
according to your vehicle's speed using a radar sensor (front) to detect the distance to the
vehicle ahead and a preset vehicle speed without you having to use the accelerator or brake
pedals.
*1 Headway Control: Control of the distance between your vehicle and the vehicle ahead

detected by the MRCC system.

Additionally, if your vehicle starts closing in on the vehicle ahead such as if the vehicle
ahead brakes suddenly, a warning sound and a warning indication in the display are
activated simultaneously to alert you to maintain a sufficient distance between the vehicles.
Also refer to the following before using the MRCC.
• Radar sensor (front) (page 4-164)

WARNING

Do not rely completely on the MRCC:
The MRCC system has detection limitations depending on the type of vehicle ahead and its
conditions, the weather conditions, and the road conditions. Additionally, the system may be
unable to decelerate sufficiently to avoid hitting the vehicle ahead if the vehicle ahead applies
the brakes suddenly or another vehicle cuts into the driving lane, which could result in an
accident.
Always drive carefully and verify the surrounding conditions and depress the brake pedal or
accelerator pedal while keeping a safer distance from vehicles ahead or on-coming vehicles.

Do not use the MRCC system in the following locations, using the MRCC system at the
following locations may result in an unexpected accident:
General roads other than highways (Driving under these conditions using the MRCC system

Roads with sharp curves and where vehicle traffic is heavy and there is insufficient space

is not possible.)

between vehicles.

Roads where frequent and repetitive acceleration and deceleration occur (Driving under

these conditions using the MRCC system is not possible).

When entering and exiting interchanges, service areas, and parking areas of highways (If

you exit a highway while headway control is in use, the vehicle ahead will no longer be
tracked and your vehicle may accelerate to the set speed).

Slippery roads such as ice or snow-bound roads (Tires could spin causing you to lose vehicle

control, or the stop hold control may not operate.)

Long, descending slopes (to maintain distance between vehicles, the system automatically

and continuously applies the brakes which could result in the loss of brake power.)
*Some models.

4-111

CX-9_8GC7-EE-17G_Edition1

2017-5-16 8:22:04

When Driving

i-ACTIVSENSE

Slopes with a steep gradient (The vehicle ahead may not be detected correctly, your vehicle

may slide while stopped by the stop hold control, and it may accelerate suddenly after it
starts moving.)

For safety purposes, switch the MRCC system off when it is not being used.

CAUTION

If your vehicle is towed or you are towing something, switch the MRCC system off to prevent a
miss-operation.

NOTE
• The MRCC system does not detect the following as physical objects.

• Vehicles approaching in the opposite direction
• Pedestrians
• Stationary objects (stopped vehicles, obstructions)
• If a vehicle ahead is traveling at an extremely low speed, the system may not detect it
correctly.

• During headway control travel, do not set the system for detection of two-wheeled
vehicles such as motorcycles and bicycles.
• Do not use the MRCC system under conditions in which close proximity warnings are
frequently activated.
• During headway control travel, the system accelerates and decelerates your vehicle in
conjunction with the speed of the vehicle ahead. However, if it is necessary to accelerate
for a lane change or if the vehicle ahead brakes suddenly causing you to close in on the
vehicle rapidly, accelerate using the accelerator pedal or decelerate using the brake
pedal depending on the conditions.
• While the MRCC system is in use, it does not cancel even if the selector lever is operated
and any intended engine braking will not occur. If deceleration is required, lower the
vehicle speed setting or depress the brake pedal.
• The sound of the automatic brakes operating may be heard, however, it does not indicate
a problem.
• The brake lights turn on while the MRCC automatic braking is operating, however, they
may not turn on while the vehicle is on a downslope at the set vehicle speed or traveling
at a constant speed and following a vehicle ahead.

activated simultaneously to alert you to maintain a sufficient distance between the vehicles.
If the vehicle ahead stops while you are following behind it, your vehicle will stop and be
held stopped automatically (stop hold control), and headway control will resume when you
resume driving the vehicle such as by pressing the RES switch.
Also refer to the following before using the MRCC with Stop & Go function.
• Forward Sensing Camera (FSC) (page 4-159)
• Radar sensor (front) (page 4-164)

WARNING

Do not rely completely on the MRCC with Stop & Go function:
The MRCC with Stop & Go function system has detection limitations depending on the type of
vehicle ahead and its conditions, the weather conditions, and the road conditions.
Additionally, the system may be unable to decelerate sufficiently to avoid hitting the vehicle
ahead if the vehicle ahead applies the brakes suddenly or another vehicle cuts into the driving
lane, which could result in an accident.
Always drive carefully and verify the surrounding conditions and depress the brake pedal or
accelerator pedal while keeping a safer distance from vehicles ahead or on-coming vehicles.

Do not use the MRCC with Stop & Go function system in the following locations, using the
MRCC with Stop & Go function system at the following locations may result in an unexpected
accident:
General roads other than highways (Driving under these conditions using the MRCC with

Stop & Go function system is not possible.)

Roads with sharp curves and where vehicle traffic is heavy and there is insufficient space

between vehicles.

Roads where frequent and repetitive acceleration and deceleration occur (Driving under

these conditions using the MRCC with Stop & Go function system is not possible).

*Some models.

When entering and exiting interchanges, service areas, and parking areas of highways (If

you exit a highway while headway control is in use, the vehicle ahead will no longer be
tracked and your vehicle may accelerate to the set speed).

Slippery roads such as ice or snow-bound roads (Tires could spin causing you to lose vehicle

control, or the stop hold control may not operate.)

Long, descending slopes (to maintain distance between vehicles, the system automatically

and continuously applies the brakes which could result in the loss of brake power.)

Slopes with a steep gradient (The vehicle ahead may not be detected correctly, your vehicle

may slide while stopped by the stop hold control, and it may accelerate suddenly after it
starts moving.)

For safety purposes, switch the MRCC with Stop & Go function system off when it is not being
used.

Do not get out of the vehicle while the stop hold control is operating:
Getting out of the vehicle while the stop hold control is operating is dangerous as the vehicle
may move unexpectedly and result in an accident. Before getting out of the vehicle, switch the
MRCC with Stop & Go function system off, shift the selector lever to the P position, and apply
the electric parking brake (EPB).

CAUTION

If your vehicle is towed or you are towing something, switch the MRCC with Stop & Go
function system off to prevent a miss-operation.

NOTE
• The MRCC with Stop & Go function system does not detect the following as physical
objects.
• Vehicles approaching in the opposite direction
• Pedestrians
• Stationary objects (stopped vehicles, obstructions)
• If a vehicle ahead is traveling at an extremely low speed, the system may not detect it
correctly.

• During headway control travel, do not set the system for detection of two-wheeled
vehicles such as motorcycles and bicycles.
• Do not use the MRCC with Stop & Go function system under conditions in which close
proximity warnings are frequently activated.

• During headway control travel, the system accelerates and decelerates your vehicle in
conjunction with the speed of the vehicle ahead. However, if it is necessary to accelerate
for a lane change or if the vehicle ahead brakes suddenly causing you to close in on the
vehicle rapidly, accelerate using the accelerator pedal or decelerate using the brake
pedal depending on the conditions.
• While the MRCC with Stop & Go function system is in use, it does not cancel even if the
selector lever is operated and any intended engine braking does not occur. If deceleration
is required, lower the set speed or depress the brake pedal.
• The sound of the automatic brakes operating may be heard, however, it does not indicate
a problem.
• The brake lights turn on while the MRCC with Stop & Go function automatic braking is
operating, however, they may not turn on while the vehicle is on a downslope at the set
vehicle speed or traveling at a constant speed and following a vehicle ahead.

Lane-keep Assist System (LAS) & Lane Departure

Warning System (LDWS)*

The LAS&LDWS alerts the driver that the vehicle may be deviating from its lane and it
provides steering assistance to help the driver stay within the vehicle lanes.
The Forward Sensing Camera (FSC) detects the white lines (yellow lines) of the vehicle
lane in which the vehicle is traveling and if the system determines that the vehicle may
deviate from its lane, it operates the electric power steering to assist the driver's steering
operation. The system also alerts the driver by activating a lane departure warning sound,
vibrating the steering wheel, and indicating an alert in the display. Use the system when you
drive the vehicle on roads with white (yellow) lines such as expressways and highways.
Refer to Forward Sensing Camera (FSC) on page 4-159.
 
The steering wheel operation of the LAS&LDWS has “Late” and “Early” steering assist
timing settings.
For the “Late” setting, the system assists the driver's steering operation if there is the
possibility of the vehicle deviating from its lane.
For the “Early” setting, the system assists the driver's steering operation constantly so that
the vehicle stays near the center of the vehicle lane.
“Late” and “Early” timing can be changed (timing at which steering operation assist is
provided) by changing the setting.
Refer to Personalization Features on page 9-10.

Smart Brake Support (SBS)*

The SBS system alerts the driver of a possible collision using a display and warning sound
if the radar sensor (front) and the Forward Sensing Camera (FSC) determine that there is the
possibility of a collision with a vehicle ahead while the vehicle is being driven at about 15
km/h or faster (10 mph or faster). Furthermore, if the radar sensor (front) and the Forward
Sensing Camera (FSC) determines that a collision is unavoidable, the automatic brake
control is performed to reduce damage in the event of a collision.
In addition, when the driver depresses the brake pedal, the brakes are applied firmly and
quickly to assist. (Brake Assist (SBS brake assist))

Do not rely completely on the SBS system and always drive carefully:
The SBS is designed to reduce damage in the event of a collision, not avoid an accident. The
ability to detect an obstruction is limited depending on the obstruction, weather conditions,
or traffic conditions. Therefore, if the accelerator pedal or brake pedal is mistakenly operated
it could result in an accident. Always verify the safety of the surrounding area and depress the

and check tire pressures monthly with a tire pressure gauge. When checking tire pressures,
use of a digital tire pressure gauge is recommended.
 
TPMS does not alleviate your need to check the pressure and condition of all four tires
regularly.

CAUTION

Each tire, including the spare (if provided), should be checked monthly when cold and

inflated to the inflation pressure recommended by the vehicle manufacturer on the vehicle
placard or tire inflation pressure label. (If your vehicle has tires of a different size than the
size indicated on the vehicle placard or tire inflation pressure label, you should determine
the proper tire inflation pressure for those tires.)

When Driving

Tire Pressure Monitoring System

As an added safety feature, your vehicle has been equipped with a tire pressure monitoring
system (TPMS) that illuminates a low tire pressure telltale when one or more of your tires is
significantly under-inflated. Accordingly, when the low tire pressure telltale illuminates, you
should stop and check your tires as soon as possible, and inflate them to the proper
pressure. Driving on a significantly under-inflated tire causes the tire to overheat and can
lead to tire failure. Under-inflation also reduces fuel efficiency and tire tread life, and may
affect the vehicle's handling and stopping ability.
Please note that the TPMS is not a substitute for proper tire maintenance, and it is the
driver's responsibility to maintain correct tire pressure, even if under-inflation has not
reached the level to trigger illumination of the TPMS low tire pressure telltale.
Your vehicle has also been equipped with a TPMS malfunction indicator to indicate when
the system is not operating properly.
The TPMS malfunction indicator is combined with the low tire pressure telltale. When the
system detects a malfunction, the telltale will flash for approximately one minute and then
remain continuously illuminated. This sequence will continue upon subsequent vehicle
start-ups as long as the malfunction exists. When the malfunction indicator is illuminated,
the system may not be able to detect or signal low tire pressure as intended. TPMS
malfunctions may occur for a variety of reasons, including the installation of replacement
or alternate tires or wheels on the vehicle that prevent the TPMS from functioning properly.
Always check the TPMS malfunction telltale after replacing one or more tires or wheels on
your vehicle to ensure that the replacement or alternate tires and wheels allow the TPMS to
continue to function properly.

To avoid false readings, the system samples for a little while before indicating a problem. As

a result it will not instantaneously register a rapid tire deflation or blow out.

▼ System Error Activation
When the warning light flashes, there may
be a system malfunction. Consult an
Authorized Mazda Dealer.
A system error activation may occur in the
following cases:
• When there is equipment or a device
near the vehicle using the same radio
frequency as that of the tire pressure
sensors.
• When a metallic device such as a
non-genuine navigation system is
equipped near the center of the
dashboard, which may block radio
signals from the tire pressure sensor to
the receiver unit.

4-176

• When using the following devices in the
vehicle that may cause radio
interference with the receiver unit.
• A digital device such as a personal
computer.
• A current converter device such as a
DC-AC converter.

• When excess snow or ice adheres to the
vehicle, especially around the wheels.
• When the tire pressure sensor batteries
are exhausted.
• When using a wheel with no tire
pressure sensor installed.
• When using tires with steel wire
reinforcement in the side walls.
• When using tire chains.

When Driving

▼ Tires and Wheels

CAUTION

When inspecting or adjusting the tire air
pressures, do not apply excessive force to
the stem part of the wheel unit. The stem
part could be damaged.
Changing tires and wheels
The following procedure allows the TPMS
to recognize a tire pressure sensor's unique
ID signal code whenever tires or wheels
are changed, such as changing to and from
winter tires.
NOTE
Each tire pressure sensor has a unique ID
signal code. The signal code must be
registered with the TPMS before it can
work. The easiest way to do it is to have
an Authorized Mazda Dealer change your
tire and complete ID signal code
registration.
When having tires changed at an
Authorized Mazda Dealer
When an Authorized Mazda Dealer
changes your vehicle's tires, they will
complete the tire pressure sensor ID signal
code registration.
 
When changing tires yourself
If you or someone else changes tires, you
or someone else can also undertake the
steps for the TPMS to complete the ID
signal code registration.
1. After tires have been changed, switch
the ignition ON, then back to ACC or
OFF.

2. Wait for about 15 minutes.

3. After about 15 minutes, drive the

vehicle at a speed of at least 25 km/h
(16 mph) for 10 minutes and the tire
pressure sensor ID signal code will be
registered automatically.

NOTE
If the vehicle is driven within about 15
minutes of changing tires, the tire pressure
monitoring system warning light will flash
because the sensor ID signal code would
not have been registered. If this happens,
park the vehicle for about 15 minutes,
after which the sensor ID signal code will
register upon driving the vehicle for 10
minutes.
Replacing tires and wheels

CAUTION

When replacing/repairing the tires or
wheels or both, have the work done by
an Authorized Mazda Dealer, or the tire
pressure sensors may be damaged.

The wheels equipped on your Mazda are
specially designed for installation of the
tire pressure sensors. Do not use
non-genuine wheels, otherwise it may
not be possible to install the tire pressure
sensors.

Be sure to have the tire pressure sensors
installed whenever tires or wheels are
replaced.
When having a tire or wheel or both
replaced, the following types of tire
pressure sensor installations are possible.
• The tire pressure sensor is removed
from the old wheel and installed to the
new one.

Climate Control System

Operating Tips

• Operate the climate control system with
the engine running.
• To prevent the battery from being
discharged, do not leave the fan control
switch on for a long period of time with
the ignition switched ON when the
engine is not running.
• Clear all obstructions such as leaves,
snow and ice from the hood and the air
inlet in the cowl grille to improve the
system efficiency.
• Use the climate control system to defog
the windows and dehumidify the air.
• The recirculate mode should be used
when driving through tunnels or while
in a traffic jam, or when you would like
to shut off outside air for quick cooling
of the interior.
• Use the outside air position for
ventilation or windshield defrosting.
• If the vehicle has been parked in direct
sunlight during hot weather, open the
windows to let warm air escape, then
run the climate control system.
• Run the air conditioner about 10
minutes at least once a month to keep
internal parts lubricated.
• Have the air conditioner checked before
the weather gets hot. Lack of refrigerant
may make the air conditioner less
efficient.

▼ Introduction
Bluetooth® Hands-Free outline
When a Bluetooth® device (mobile phone) is connected to the vehicle's Bluetooth® unit via
radio wave transmission, a call can be made or received by pressing the talk button, pick-up
button, or hang-up button on the audio remote control switch, or by operating the center
display. For example, even if a device (mobile phone) is in your coat pocket, a call can be

Bluetooth® audio outline
When a portable audio unit equipped with the Bluetooth® communication function is paired
to the vehicle, you can listen to music stored on the paired portable audio device from the
vehicle's speakers. It is not necessary to connect the portable audio device to the vehicle's
external input terminal. After programming, operate the vehicle audio control panel to play/
stop the audio.
 
NOTE
• For your safety, a device can be paired only when the vehicle is parked. If the vehicle
starts to move, the pairing procedure will end. Park the vehicle in a safe place before
pairing.
• The communication range of a Bluetooth® equipped device is about 10 meters (32 ft) or
less.
• Basic audio operation is available using voice commands even if Bluetooth® is not
connected.
• For safety reasons, operation of the center display is disabled while the vehicle is being
driven. However, items not displayed in gray can be operated using the commander
switch while the vehicle is being driven.

CAUTION

Some Bluetooth® mobile devices are not compatible with the vehicle. Consult an Authorized
Mazda Repairer, Mazda's call center or Web support center for information regarding

To prevent a deterioration in the voice
recognition rate and voice quality, the
following points should be observed:
• The voice recognition cannot be
performed while voice guidance or the
beep sound is operating. Wait until the
voice guidance or the beep sound is
finished before saying your commands.
• Phone related commands are available
only when your phone is connected via
Bluetooth®. Make sure your phone is
connected via Bluetooth® before you
operate phone related voice commands.
• Music play commands, such as Play
Artist and Play Album can be used only
in USB audio mode.
• Do not speak too slowly or loudly (no
loud voice).
• Speak clearly, without pausing between
words or numbers.
• Dialects or different wording other than
hands-free prompts cannot be
recognized by voice recognition. Speak
in the wording specified by the voice
commands.
• It is not necessary to face the
microphone or approach it. Speak the
voice commands while maintaining a
safe driving position.
• Close the windows and/or the sunroof to
reduce loud noises from outside the
vehicle, or turn down the airflow of the
climate control system while Bluetooth®
Hands-Free is being used.
• Make sure the vents are not directing air
up towards the microphone.

NOTE
If the voice recognition performance is not
satisfactory.

Things You Need to Know

Do not spill any liquid on the audio
system.

▼ Radio Reception
AM characteristics
AM signals bend around such things as
buildings or mountains and bounce off the
ionosphere.
Therefore, they can reach longer distances
than FM signals.
Because of this, two stations may
sometimes be picked up on the same
frequency at the same time.

Ionosphere

Station 1

Station 2

Interior Features

Appendix

WARNING

Always adjust the audio while the vehicle is
stopped:
Do not adjust the audio control switches
while driving the vehicle. Adjusting the
audio while driving the vehicle is
dangerous as it could distract your
attention from the vehicle operation which
could lead to a serious accident.
Even if the audio control switches are
equipped on the steering wheel, learn to
use the switches without looking down at
them so that you can keep your maximum
attention on the road while driving the
vehicle.

CAUTION

For the purposes of safe driving, adjust the
audio volume to a level that allows you to
hear sounds outside of the vehicle
including car horns and particularly
emergency vehicle sirens.

NOTE
• To prevent the battery from being
discharged, do not leave the audio
system on for a long period of time when
the engine is not running.
• If a cellular phone or CB radio is used
in or near the vehicle, it could cause
noise to occur from the audio system,
however, this does not indicate that the
system has been damaged.

Appendix

FM characteristics
An FM broadcast range is usually about
40―50 km (25―30 miles) from the
source. Because of extra coding needed to
break the sound into two channels, stereo
FM has even less range than monaural
(non-stereo) FM.

FM Station

Multipath noise
Since FM signals can be reflected by
obstructions, it is possible to receive both
the direct signal and the reflected signal at
the same time. This causes a slight delay
in reception and may be heard as a broken
sound or a distortion. This problem may
also be encountered when in close
proximity to the transmitter.

Direct

Reflected wave

Flutter/Skip noise
Signals from an FM transmitter move in
straight lines and become weak in valleys
between tall buildings, mountains, and
other obstacles. When a vehicle passes
through such an area, the reception
conditions may change suddenly, resulting
in annoying noise.

40—50km 
(25—30 miles)

Signals from an FM transmitter are similar
to beams of light because they do not bend
around corners, but they do reflect. Unlike
AM signals, FM signals cannot travel
beyond the horizon. Therefore, FM
stations cannot be received at the great
distances possible with AM reception.

Ionosphere

FM wave

AM wave

FM wave

100—200 km (60—120 miles)

Atmospheric conditions can also affect
FM reception. High humidity will cause
poor reception. However, cloudy days may
provide better reception than clear days.

Appendix

Weak signal noise
In suburban areas, broadcast signals
become weak because of distance from the
transmitter. Reception in such fringe areas
is characterized by sound breakup.

Strong signal noise
This occurs very close to a transmitter
tower. The broadcast signals are extremely
strong, so the result is noise and sound
breakup at the radio receiver.

Station drift noise
When a vehicle reaches the area of two
strong stations broadcasting at similar
frequencies, the original station may be
temporarily lost and the second station
picked up. At this time there will be some
noise from this disturbance.

Maintenance and Care

Essential Information

Introduction

Be careful not to hurt yourself when inspecting your vehicle, replacing a tire, or doing some
kind of maintenance such as car washing.
In particular, wear thick work gloves such as cotton gloves when touching areas that are
difficult to see while inspecting or working on your vehicle. Doing inspections or
procedures with your bare hands could cause injury.
 
If you are unsure about any procedure it describes, we strongly urge you to have a reliable
and qualified technician perform the work, we recommend an Authorized Mazda Repairer.
 
Authorized Mazda technicians and genuine Mazda parts are dedicated to your vehicle.
Without this expertise and the parts that have been designed and made especially for your
Mazda, inadequate, incomplete, and insufficient servicing may result in problems. This
could lead to vehicle damage or an accident and injuries.
 
For expert advice and quality service, consult an expert repairer, we recommend an
Authorized Mazda Repairer.
 
The owner should retain evidence that proper maintenance has been performed as
prescribed.
 
A claim against a warranty will not qualify if it results from lack of maintenance and not
from defective material or authorized workmanship.
 
The malfunction diagnosis connector is designed exclusively for connecting the specially
designed device to perform on-board diagnosis.
Do not connect any devices other than the specially designed malfunction diagnosis devices
for servicing. If any device other than the malfunction diagnosis device is connected, it may
affect the vehicle's electrical devices or lead to damage such as battery depletion.

Engine oil viscosity, or thickness, has an effect on fuel economy and cold-weather operation
(starting and oil flow).
Low-viscosity engine oils can provide improved fuel economy and cold-weather
performance.
 
When choosing an oil, consider the temperature range your vehicle will operate in before
the next oil change.
Then select the recommended viscosity from the chart.

NOTE
• It is normal for all engines to consume engine oil under normal driving conditions.
Engine oil consumption may be as high as 0.8 L/1,000 km (1 L/800 miles). This may be as
a result of evaporation, internal ventilation or burning of the lubricating oil in the
working engine. Oil consumption may be higher when the engine is new due to the
running-in process. Oil consumption is also dependant on engine speed and engine load.
Under extreme driving conditions, oil consumption may be higher.

▼ Vehicle Engine Control Unit Reset Procedure
After replacing the engine oil, it is recommended to have a repair shop such as an
Authorized Mazda Repairer perform the initialization (engine oil data resetting) of the
recorded value. If the value recorded by the computer is not initialized, the wrench indicator
light may not turn off or it may turn on earlier than normal.
NOTE
There are two methods for resetting the engine control unit.
1. The procedure described in the following.
2. The procedure described in the maintenance monitor item when the flexible maintenance

setting is selected. Refer to Maintenance Monitor on page 6-11.

If either one of the methods is performed, resetting of the engine control unit is completed.
 
NOTE
The initialization (engine oil data resetting) of the recorded value can be performed using
the following procedure:
1. Switch the ignition OFF.

Engine Coolant

▼ Inspecting Coolant Level

WARNING

Do not use a match or live flame in the
engine compartment. DO NOT ADD
COOLANT WHEN THE ENGINE IS HOT:
A hot engine is dangerous. If the engine has
been running, parts of the engine
compartment can become very hot. You
could be burned. Carefully inspect the
engine coolant in the coolant reservoir, but
do not open it.

Pull over to a safe location, then switch

the ignition off and make sure the fan is
not running before attempting to work
near the cooling fan:
Working near the cooling fan when it is
running is dangerous. The fan could
continue running indefinitely even if the
engine has stopped and the engine
compartment temperature is high. You
could be hit by the fan and seriously
injured.

 Do not remove either cooling
system cap when the engine and radiator
are hot:
When the engine and radiator are hot,
scalding coolant and steam may shoot out
under pressure and cause serious injury.

6-22

NOTE
Changing the coolant should be done by
an expert repairer, we recommend an
Authorized Mazda Repairer.
Inspect the antifreeze protection and
coolant level in the coolant reservoir at
least once a year―at the beginning of the
winter season―and before traveling where
temperatures may drop below freezing.
 
Inspect the condition and connections of
all cooling system and heater hoses.
Replace any that are swollen or
deteriorated.
 
The coolant should be at full in the
radiator and between the F and L marks on
the coolant reservoir when the engine is
cool.
 

If it is at or near L, add enough coolant to
the coolant reservoir to provide freezing
and corrosion protection and to bring the
level to F.
Securely tighten the coolant reservoir tank
cap after adding coolant.

CX-9_8GC7-EE-17G_Edition1

2017-5-16 8:22:04

CAUTION

Radiator coolant will damage paint.

Rinse it off quickly if spilled.

If the “FL22” mark is shown on or near
the cooling system cap, use of FL-22is
recommended when replacing engine
coolant. Using engine coolant other than
FL-22 may cause serious damage to the
engine and cooling system.

 

If the coolant reservoir is empty or new
coolant is required frequently, consult an
expert repairer, we recommend an
Authorized Mazda Repairer.

Maintenance and Care

Owner Maintenance

Brake Fluid

▼ Inspecting Brake Fluid Level

WARNING

If the brake fluid level is low, have the
brakes inspected:
A low brake fluid level is dangerous.
A low level could indicate brake lining wear
or a brake system leak which could cause
the brakes to fail and lead to an accident.
Inspect the fluid level in the reservoir
regularly. It should be kept between the
MAX and MIN lines.
The level normally drops with
accumulated distance, a condition
associated with wear of brake linings. If it
is excessively low, have the brake system
inspected by an expert repairer, we
recommend an Authorized Mazda
Repairer.

Wiper Blades

CAUTION

Hot waxes applied by automatic car

washers have been known to affect the
wiper's ability to clean windows.

To prevent damage to the wiper blades,

do not use gasoline, kerosene, paint
thinner, or other solvents on or near
them.

When the wiper lever is in the AUTO

position and the ignition is switched ON,
the wipers may move automatically in
the following cases:
If the windshield above the rain sensor

is touched.

If the windshield above the rain sensor

is wiped with a cloth.

If the windshield is struck with a hand

or other object.

If the rain sensor is struck with a hand
or other object from inside the vehicle.
Be careful not to pinch hands or fingers
as it may cause injury, or damage the
wipers. When washing or servicing the
vehicle, make sure the wiper lever is in
the OFF position.

Contamination of either the windshield or
the blades with foreign matter can reduce
wiper effectiveness. Common sources are
insects, tree sap, and hot wax treatments
used by some commercial car washes.
 
If the blades are not wiping properly, clean
the window and blades with a good
cleaner or mild detergent; then rinse
thoroughly with clean water. Repeat if
necessary.

Tires

For reasons of proper performance, safety,
and better fuel economy, always maintain
recommended tire inflation pressures and
stay within the recommended load limits
and weight distribution.
WARNING

Using Different Tire Types:
Driving your vehicle with different types of
tires is dangerous. It could cause poor
handling and poor braking; leading to loss
of control.
Except for the limited use of the temporary
spare tire, use only the same type tires
(radial, bias-belted, bias-type) on all four
wheels.

Using Wrong-Sized Tires:
Using any other tire size than what is
specified for the vehicle (page 9-7) is
dangerous. It could seriously affect ride,
handling, ground clearance, tire clearance,
and speedometer calibration. This could
cause you to have an accident. Use only
tires that are the correct size specified for
the vehicle.
▼ Tire Inflation Pressure

WARNING

Always inflate the tires to the correct
pressure:
Overinflation or underinflation of tires is
dangerous. Adverse handling or
unexpected tire failure could result in a
serious accident.
Refer to Tires on page 9-7.
6-36

Use only a Mazda-genuine tire valve cap:
Use of a non-genuine part is dangerous as
the correct tire air pressure cannot be
maintained if the tire valve becomes
damaged. If the vehicle is driven under this
condition, the tire air pressure will decrease
which could result in a serious accident. Do
not use any part for the tire valve cap that
is not a Mazda-genuine part.
Inspect all tire pressures monthly
(including the spare) when the tires are
cold. Maintain recommended pressures for
the best ride, handling, and minimum tire
wear.
Refer to the specification charts (page 9-
7).
NOTE
• Always check tire pressure when tires
are cold.
• Warm tires normally exceed
recommended pressures. Do not release
air from warm tires to adjust the
pressure.
• Underinflation can cause reduced fuel
economy, uneven and accelerated tire
wear, and poor sealing of the tire bead,
which will deform the wheel and cause
separation of tire from rim.
• Overinflation can produce a harsh ride,
uneven and accelerated tire wear, and a
greater possibility of damage from road
hazards.
Keep your tire pressure at the correct
levels. If one frequently needs inflating,
have it inspected.

CX-9_8GC7-EE-17G_Edition1

2017-5-16 8:22:04

▼ Tire Rotation

WARNING

Rotate tires periodically:
Irregular tire wear is dangerous. To
equalize tread wear for maintaining good
performance in handling and braking,
rotate the tires every 10,000 km (6,250
miles), or sooner if irregular wear develops.
During rotation, inspect them for correct
balance.
 

Forward

Do not include (TEMPORARY USE ONLY) 
spare tire in rotation.
Also, inspect them for uneven wear and
damage. Abnormal wear is usually caused
by one or a combination of the following:
 

• Incorrect tire pressure
• Improper wheel alignment
• Out-of-balance wheel
• Severe braking

 
After rotation, inflate all tire pressures to
specification (page 9-7) and inspect the
lug nuts for tightness.

Maintenance and Care

Owner Maintenance

CAUTION

Rotate unidirectional tires and radial tires
that have an asymmetrical tread pattern or
studs only from front to rear, not from side
to side. Tire performance will be reduced if
rotated from side to side.
▼ Replacing a Tire

WARNING

Always use tires that are in good condition:
Driving with worn tires is dangerous.
Reduced braking, steering, and traction
could result in an accident.

Replace all four tires at the same time:
Replacing just one tire is dangerous. It
could cause poor handling and poor
braking resulting in loss of vehicle control.
Mazda strongly recommends that you
replace all four tires at the same time.
If a tire wears evenly, a wear indicator will
appear as a solid band across the tread.
Replace the tire when this happens.

Tread wear indicator

New tread

Worn tread

You should replace the tire before the band
crosses the entire tread.

Maintenance and Care

Owner Maintenance

▼ Temporary Spare Tire
Inspect the temporary spare tire at least
monthly to make sure it is properly
inflated and stored.
NOTE
The temporary spare tire condition
gradually deteriorates even if it has not
been used.
The temporary spare tire is easier to
handle because of its construction which is
lighter and smaller than a conventional
tire. This tire should be used only for an
emergency and only for a short distance.
 
Use the temporary spare tire only until the
conventional tire is repaired, which should
be as soon as possible.
 
Refer to Tire on page 9-7.

CAUTION

Do not use your temporary spare tire rim

with a snow tire or a conventional tire.
Neither will properly fit and could
damage both tire and rim.

The temporary spare tire has a tread life
of less than 5,000 km (3,000 miles). The
tread life may be shorter depending on
driving conditions.

The temporary spare tire is for limited

use, however, if the tread wear
solid-band indicator appears, replace the
tire with the same type of temporary
spare (page 6-37).

6-38

*Some models.

▼ Replacing a Wheel

WARNING

Always use wheels of the correct size on
your vehicle:
Using a wrong-sized wheel is dangerous.
Braking and handling could be affected,
leading to loss of control and an accident.

CAUTION

A wrong-sized wheel may adversely affect:
Tire fit
Wheel and bearing life
Ground clearance
Snow-chain clearance
Speedometer calibration
Headlight aim
Bumper height
Tire Pressure Monitoring System*

NOTE
• When replacing a wheel, make sure the
new one is the same as the original
factory wheel in diameter, rim width,
and offset (inset/outset).
• For details, contact an expert repairer,
we recommend an Authorized Mazda
Repairer.

 
Proper tire balancing provides the best
riding comfort and helps reduce tread
wear. Out-of-balance tires can cause
vibration and uneven wear, such as
cupping and flat spots.

Exterior Care

The paintwork on your Mazda represents
the latest technical developments in
composition and methods of application.
 
Environmental hazards, however, can
harm the paint's protective properties, if
proper care is not taken.
 
Here are some examples of possible
damage, with tips on how to prevent them.
Etching Caused by Acid Rain or
Industrial Fallout
Occurrence
Industrial pollutants and vehicle emissions
drift into the air and mix with rain or dew
to form acids. These acids can settle on a
vehicle's finish. As the water evaporates,
the acid becomes concentrated and can
damage the finish.
And the longer the acid remains on the
surface, the greater the chance is for
damage.
Prevention
It is necessary to wash and wax your
vehicle to preserve its finish according to
the instructions in this section. These steps
should be taken immediately after you
suspect that acid rain has settled on your
vehicle's finish.

Maintenance and Care

Appearance Care

Damage Caused by Bird Dropping,
Insects, or Tree Sap
Occurrence
Bird droppings contain acids. If these are
not removed they can eat away the clear
and color base coat of the vehicle's
paintwork.
 
When insects stick to the paint surface and
decompose, corrosive compounds form.
These can erode the clear and color base
coat of the vehicle's paintwork if they are
not removed.
 
Tree sap will harden and adhere
permanently to the paint finish. If you
scratch the sap off while it is hard, some
vehicle paint could come off with it.
Prevention
It is necessary to have your Mazda washed
and waxed to preserve its finish according
to the instructions in this section. This
should be done as soon as possible.
 
Bird droppings can be removed with a soft
sponge and water. If you are traveling and
these are not available, a moistened tissue
may also take care of the problem. The
cleaned area should be waxed according to
the instructions in this section.
Insects and tree sap are best removed with
a soft sponge and water or a commercially
available chemical cleaner.
 
Another method is to cover the affected
area with dampened newspaper for one to
two hours. After removing the newspaper,
rinse off the loosened debris with water.

2017-5-16 8:22:04

Maintenance and Care

Appearance Care

Water Marks
Occurrence
Rain, fog, dew, and even tap water can
contain harmful minerals such as salt and
lime. If moisture containing these minerals
settles on the vehicle and evaporates, the
minerals will concentrate and harden to
form white rings. The rings can damage
your vehicle's finish.
Prevention
It is necessary to wash and wax your
vehicle to preserve its finish according to
the instructions in this section. These steps
should be taken immediately after you find
water marks on your vehicle's finish.
Paint Chipping
Occurrence
Paint chipping occurs when gravel thrown
in the air by another vehicle's tires hits
your vehicle.
How to avoid paint chipping
Keeping a safe distance between you and
the vehicle ahead reduces the chances of
having your paint chipped by flying
gravel.
NOTE
• The paint chipping zone varies with the
speed of the vehicle. For example, when
traveling at 90 km/h (56 mph), the paint
chipping zone is 50 m (164 ft).
• In low temperatures a vehicle's finish
hardens. This increases the chance of
paint chipping.

6-56

• Chipped paint can lead to rust forming
on your Mazda. Before this happens,
repair the damage by using Mazda
touch-up paint according to the
instructions in this section. Failure to
repair the affected area could lead to
serious rusting and expensive repairs.

 
Follow all label and container directions
when using a chemical cleaner or polish.
Read all warnings and cautions.
▼ Maintaining the Finish
Washing

CAUTION

When the wiper lever is in the 

position and the ignition is switched ON,
the wipers may move automatically in
the following cases:
If the windshield above the rain sensor

is touched or wiped with a cloth.

If the windshield is struck with a hand
or other object from either outside or
inside the vehicle.

Keep hands and scrapers clear of the
windshield when the wiper lever is in the

 position and the ignition is

switched ON as fingers could be pinched
or the wipers and wiper blades damaged
when the wipers activate automatically.
If you are going to clean the windshield,
be sure the wipers are turned off
completely (when it is most likely that the
engine is left running) this is particularly
important when clearing ice and snow.

CX-9_8GC7-EE-17G_Edition1

2017-5-16 8:22:04

Do not spray water in the engine

compartment. Otherwise, it could result
in engine-starting problems or damage
to electrical parts.

When washing and waxing the vehicle,
be careful not to apply excessive force to
any single area of the vehicle roof.
Otherwise, you could dent the vehicle.
To help protect the finish from rust and
deterioration, wash your Mazda
thoroughly and frequently, at least once a
month, with lukewarm or cold water.
 
If the vehicle is washed improperly, the
paint surface could be scratched. Here are
some examples of how scratching could
occur.
 
Scratches occur on the paint surface when:
• The vehicle is washed without first
rinsing off dirt and other foreign matter.
• The vehicle is washed with a rough, dry,
or dirty cloth.
• The vehicle is washed at a car wash that
uses brushes that are dirty or too stiff.
• Cleansers or wax containing abrasives
are used.

NOTE
• Mazda is not responsible for scratches
caused by automatic car washes or
improper washing.
• Scratches are more noticeable on
vehicles with darker paint finishes.
To minimize scratches on the vehicle's
paint finish:
• Rinse off any dirt or other foreign matter
using lukewarm or cold water before
washing.

Maintenance and Care

Appearance Care

• Use plenty of lukewarm or cold water
and a soft cloth when washing the
vehicle. Do not use a nylon cloth.
• Rub gently when washing or drying the
vehicle.
• Take your vehicle only to a car wash
that keeps its brushes well maintained.
• Do not use abrasive cleansers or wax
that contain abrasives.

CAUTION

Do not use steel wool, abrasive cleaners,

or strong detergents containing highly
alkaline or caustic agents on
chrome-plated or anodized aluminum
parts. This may damage the protective
coating; also, cleaners and detergents
may discolor or deteriorate the paint.

Pay special attention to removing salt, dirt,
mud, and other foreign material from the
underside of the fenders, and make sure
the drain holes in the lower edges of the
doors and rocker panels are clean.
 
Insects, tar, tree sap, bird droppings,
industrial fallout, and similar deposits can
damage the finish if not removed
immediately. When prompt washing with
plain water is ineffective, use a mild soap
made for use on vehicles.
 
Thoroughly rinse off all soap with
lukewarm or cold water. Do not allow
soap to dry on the finish.
 
After washing the vehicle, dry it with a
clean chamois to prevent water spots from
forming.

WARNING

Dry off brakes that have become wet by
driving slowly, releasing the accelerator
pedal and lightly applying the brakes
several times until the brake performance
returns to normal:
Driving with wet brakes is dangerous.
Increased stopping distance or the vehicle
pulling to one side when braking could
result in a serious accident. Light braking
will indicate whether the brakes have been
affected.
When using an automatic car wash
• Retract the door mirrors.
• The automatic car wash brushes could
reduce the paint lustre or hasten paint
deterioration.

When using a high water pressure car
wash
High water temperature and high water
pressure car washers are available
depending on the type of car wash
machine. If the car washer nozzle is put
too close to the vehicle, the force of the
spray could damage or deform the
molding, affect the sealability of parts, and
allow water to penetrate the interior. Keep
a sufficient space (30 cm (12 in) or more)
between the nozzle and the vehicle. In
addition, do not spend too much time
spraying the same area of the vehicle, and
be very careful when spraying between
gaps in doors and around windows.
Waxing
Your vehicle needs to be waxed when
water no longer beads on the finish.

6-58

Always wash and dry the vehicle before
waxing it. In addition to the vehicle body,
wax the metal trim to maintain its luster.
 
1. Use wax which contains no abrasives.
Waxes containing abrasive will remove
paint and could damage bright metal
parts.

2. Use a good grade of natural wax for

metallic, mica, and solid colors.

3. When waxing, coat evenly with the

sponge supplied or a soft cloth.

4. Wipe off the wax with a soft cloth.
NOTE
A spot remover to remove oil, tar, and
similar materials will usually also take off
the wax. Rewax these areas even if the rest
of the vehicle does not need it.
▼ Paint Damage Touch-up
Repair damage to the finish caused by
stone chipping, damage during parking
etc., by using Mazda touch-up paint before
rust begins to form. First, remove the dirt
and grease with a clean soft cloth.
 
If rust has already begun to form:
 
1. Remove rust completely with

▼ Spare Tire
Your Mazda has a temporary spare tire.
The temporary spare tire is lighter and
smaller than a conventional tire, and is
designed only for emergency use and
should be used only for VERY short
periods. Temporary spare tires should
NEVER be used for long drives or
extended periods.

WARNING

Do not install the temporary spare tire on
the front wheels (driving wheels):
Driving with the temporary spare tire on
one of the front driving wheels is
dangerous. Handling will be affected. You
could lose control of the vehicle, especially
on ice or snow bound roads, and have an
accident. Move a regular tire to the front
wheel and install the temporary spare tire
to the rear.

CAUTION

When using the temporary spare tire,

driving stability may decrease compared
to when using only the conventional tire.
Drive carefully.

To avoid damage to the temporary spare

tire or to the vehicle, observe the
following precautions:
Do not exceed 80 km/h (50 mph).
Avoid driving over obstacles. Also, do

not drive through an automatic car
wash. This tire's diameter is smaller
than a conventional tire, so the ground
clearance is reduced.

Changing a Flat Tire

NOTE
If the following occurs while driving, it
could indicate a flat tire.
• Steering becomes difficult.
• The vehicle begins to vibrate
excessively.
• The vehicle pulls in one direction.
If you have a flat tire, drive slowly to a
level spot that is well off the road and out
of the way of traffic to change the tire.
Stopping in traffic or on the shoulder of a
busy road is dangerous.
WARNING

Be sure to follow the directions for
changing a tire:
Changing a tire is dangerous if not done
properly. The vehicle can slip off the jack
and seriously injure someone.
No person should place any portion of their
body under a vehicle that is supported by a
jack.

Never allow anyone inside a vehicle
supported by a jack:
Allowing someone to remain in a vehicle
supported by a jack is dangerous. The
occupant could cause the vehicle to fall
resulting in serious injury.

If Trouble Arises

Push-Starting
Do not push-start your Mazda.

WARNING

Never tow a vehicle to start it:
Towing a vehicle to start it is dangerous.
The vehicle being towed could surge
forward when its engine starts, causing the
two vehicles to collide. The occupants
could be injured.

NOTE
You cannot start a vehicle with an
automatic transaxle by pushing it.

Starting a Flooded Engine
If the engine fails to start, it may be
flooded (excessive fuel in the engine).
 
Follow this procedure:
 
1.

If the engine does not start within five
seconds on the first try, wait ten
seconds and try again.

2. Make sure the parking brake is on.
3. Depress the accelerator all the way and

hold it there.

4. Depress the brake pedal, then press the

5.

push button start. If the engine starts,
release the accelerator immediately
because the engine will suddenly rev
up.
If the engine fails to start, crank it

Overheating

Overheating

If the temperature gauge indicates
overheating or the high engine coolant
temperature warning light turns on, the
vehicle loses power, or you hear a loud
knocking or pinging noise, the engine is
probably too hot.

WARNING

Pull over to a safe location, then switch

the ignition off and make sure the fan is
not running before attempting to work
near the cooling fan:
Working near the cooling fan when it is
running is dangerous. The fan could
continue running indefinitely even if the
engine has stopped and the engine
compartment temperature is high. You
could be hit by the fan and seriously
injured.

Do not remove either cooling

system cap when the engine and radiator
are hot:
When the engine and radiator are hot,
scalding coolant and steam may shoot out
under pressure and cause serious injury.

Open the hood ONLY after steam is no
longer escaping from the engine:
Steam from an overheated engine is
dangerous. The escaping steam could
seriously burn you.

7-32

If the temperature gauge indicates
overheating or the high engine coolant
temperature warning light turns on:
 
1. Drive safely to the side of the road and

park off the right-of-way.

2. Shift into park (P).
3. Apply the parking brake.
4. Turn off the air conditioner.
5. Check whether coolant or steam is

escaping from the engine
compartment.
 
If steam is coming from the engine
compartment:
Do not go near the front of the vehicle.
Stop the engine.
Wait until the steam dissipates, then
open the hood and start the engine.
 
If neither coolant nor steam is
escaping:
Open the hood and idle the engine
until it cools.

CAUTION

If the cooling fan does not operate
while the engine is running, the engine
temperature will increase. Stop the
engine and call an expert repairer, we
recommend an Authorized Mazda
Repairer.

6. Make sure the cooling fan is operating,

then turn off the engine after the
temperature has decreased.

WARNING

Always tow a 4WD vehicle with all four
wheels off the ground:
Towing a 4WD vehicle with either the front
or rear wheels on the ground is dangerous
as the drive train could be damaged, or the
vehicle could trail away from the tow truck
and cause an accident. If the drive train has
been damaged, transport the vehicle on a
flatbed truck.

CAUTION

Do not tow the vehicle pointed backward

with driving wheels on the ground. This

Emergency Towing

Towing Description

We recommend that towing be done only
by an expert repairer, we recommend an
Authorized Mazda Repairer or a
commercial tow-truck service.
 
Proper lifting and towing are necessary to
prevent damage to the vehicle. Particularly
when towing a 4WD vehicle, where all the
wheels are connected to the drive train,
proper transporting of the vehicle is
absolutely essential to avoid damaging the
drive system. Government and local laws
must be followed.

Wheel dollies

 
A towed 2WD vehicle should have its
drive wheels (front wheels) off the ground.
If excessive damage or other conditions
prevent this, use wheel dollies.
 
When towing a 2WD vehicle with the rear
wheels on the ground, release the parking
brake.
Refer to Electric Parking Brake (EPB) on
page 4-67.
 
A towed 4WD vehicle must have all its

Fasten the seat belts.

The seat belt warning light turns on if the

If the driver or front passenger's seat belt is
unfastened (only when the front passenger's
seat is occupied) and the vehicle is driven at
a speed faster than about 20 km/h (12 mph),
the warning light flashes. After a short time,
the warning light stops flashing, but re-

fastened, the warning light flashes again for
a given period of time.
NOTE
•If the driver or front passenger's seat belt
is unfastened after the warning light turns
on, and the vehicle speed exceeds 20 km/h
(12 mph), the warning light flashes again.
•Placing heavy items on the front passeng-

seat belt warning function to operate de-
pending on the weight of the item.
•To allow the front passenger seat weight
sensor to function properly, do not place
and sit on an additional seat cushion on
the front passenger's seat. The sensor may
not function properly because the addi-

Tire Pressure Monitoring System Warning Light (Turns on)*

Take the appropriate action and verify that the warning light turns off.

Warning

When the warning light illuminates, and the warning beep sound is heard when tire pressure is too low in one or
more tires.

WARNING

If the tire pressure monitoring system warning light illuminates or flashes, or the tire pressure warning beep sound
is heard, decrease vehicle speed immediately and avoid sudden maneuvering and braking:
If the tire pressure monitoring system warning light illuminates or flashes, or the tire pressure warning beep sound
is heard, it is dangerous to drive the vehicle at high speeds, or perform sudden maneuvering or braking. Vehicle
drivability could worsen and result in an accident.
To determine if you have a slow leak or a flat, pull over to a safe position where you can check the visual condition
of the tire and determine if you have enough air to proceed to a place where air may be added and the system
monitored again by an expert repairer, we recommend an Authorized Mazda Repairer or a tire repair station.

Do not ignore the TPMS Warning Light:
Ignoring the TPMS warning light is dangerous, even if you know why it is illuminated. Have the problem taken
care of as soon as possible before it develops into a more serious situation that could lead to tire failure and a
dangerous accident.

If Trouble Arises

Warning/Indicator Lights and Warning Sounds

Inspect the tires and adjust to the specified inflation pressure (page 6-36).

Action to be taken

CAUTION

When replacing/repairing the tires or wheels or both, have the work done by an Authorized Mazda Repairer, or
the tire pressure sensors may be damaged.

NOTE
•Perform tire pressure adjustment when the tires are cold. Tire pressure will vary according to the tire tempera-
ture, therefore let the vehicle stand for 1 hour or only drive it 1.6 km (1 mile) or less before adjusting the tire
pressures. When pressure is adjusted on hot tires to the cold inflation pressure, the TPMS warning light/beep
may turn on after the tires cool and pressure drops below specification.
Also, an illuminated TPMS warning light, resulting from the tire air pressure dropping due to cold ambient
temperature, may turn off if the ambient temperature rises. In this case, it will also be necessary to adjust the
tire air pressures. If the TPMS warning light illuminates due to a drop in tire air pressure, make sure to check
and adjust the tire air pressures.
•After adjusting the tire air pressures, it may require some time for the TPMS warning light to turn off. If the
TPMS warning light remains illuminated, drive the vehicle at a speed of at least 25 km/h (16 mph) for 10 mi-
nutes, and then verify that it turns off.
•Tires lose air naturally over time and the TPMS cannot tell if the tires are getting too soft over time or you
have a flat. However, when you find one low tire in a set of four-that is an indication of trouble; you should
have someone drive the vehicle slowly forward so you can inspect any low tire for cuts and any metal objects
sticking through tread or sidewall. Put a few drops of water in the valve stem to see if it bubbles indicating a
bad valve. Leaks need to be addressed by more than simply refilling the trouble tire as leaks are dangerous ―
take it to an expert repairer, we recommend an Authorized Mazda Repairer which has all the equipment to fix
tires, TPMS systems and order the best replacement tire for your vehicle.
If the warning light illuminates again even after the tire pressures are adjusted, there may be a tire puncture.
