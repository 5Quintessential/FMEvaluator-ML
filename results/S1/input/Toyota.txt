For your information

Main Owner’s Manual
Please note that this manual applies to all models and explains all equipment,
including options. Therefore, you may find some explanations for equipment
not installed on your vehicle. 
All specifications provided in this manual are current at the time of printing.
However, because of the Toyota policy of continual product improvement, we
reserve the right to make changes at any time without notice.
Depending on specifications, the vehicle shown in the illustrations may differ
from your vehicle in terms of color and equipment.
Noise from under vehicle after turning off the engine
Approximately five hours after the engine is turned off, you may hear sound
coming from under the vehicle for several minutes. This is the sound of a fuel
evaporation leakage check and it does not indicate a malfunction.
Accessories, spare parts and modification of your Toyota
A wide variety of non-genuine spare parts and accessories for Toyota vehi-
cles are currently available in the market. You should know that Toyota does
not  warrant  these  products  and  is  not  responsible  for  their  performance,
repair,  or  replacement,  or  for  any  damage  they  may  cause  to,  or  adverse
effect they may have on, your Toyota vehicle.
This vehicle should not be modified with non-genuine Toyota products. Modi-
fication with non-genuine Toyota products could affect its performance, safety
or  durability,  and  may  even  violate  governmental  regulations.  In  addition,
damage or performance problems resulting from the modification may not be
covered under warranty.

SEQUOIA_OM_USA_OM0C013U_19MY

Installation of a mobile two-way radio system
The installation of a mobile two-way radio system in your vehicle could affect
electronic systems such as: 
●Multiport fuel injection system/sequential multiport fuel injection system
●Toyota Safety Sense P
●Dynamic radar cruise control system
●Anti-lock brake system
●SRS airbag system
●Seat belt pretensioner system
Be sure to check with your Toyota dealer for precautionary measures or spe-
cial instructions regarding installation of a mobile two-way radio system.
Vehicle data recordings
Your Toyota is equipped with several sophisticated computers that will record
certain data, such as:

• Engine speed
• Accelerator status
• Brake status
• Vehicle speed
• Shift position
The recorded data varies according to the vehicle grade level and options
with which it is equipped. These computers do not record conversations or
sounds, and only record images outside of the vehicle in certain situations.
● Data Transmission

Your vehicle may transmit the data recorded in these computers to Toyota
without notification to you.

● Data usage

Toyota may use the data recorded in these computers to diagnose malfunc-
tions, conduct research and development, and improve quality.
Toyota will not disclose the recorded data to a third party except:
• With the consent of the vehicle owner or with the consent of the lessee if

• In response to an official request by the police, a court of law or a govern-

• For use by Toyota in a lawsuit
• For research purposes where the data is not tied to a specific vehicle or

the vehicle is leased

ment agency

vehicle owner

SEQUOIA_OM_USA_OM0C013U_19MY

10

Event data recorder
This vehicle is equipped with an event data recorder (EDR). The main pur-
pose of an EDR is to record, in certain crash or near crash-like situations,
such as an air bag deployment or hitting a road obstacle, data that will assist
in understanding how a vehicle’s systems performed. The EDR is designed to
record data related to vehicle dynamics and safety systems for a short period
of time, typically 30 seconds or less.
The EDR in this vehicle is designed to record such data as:

• How various systems in your vehicle were operating;
• Whether or not the driver and passenger safety belts were buckled/fas-

tened;

pedal; and,

• How far (if at all) the driver was depressing the accelerator and/or brake

• How fast the vehicle was traveling.

These data can help provide a better understanding of the circumstances in
which crashes and injuries occur.
NOTE: EDR data are recorded by your vehicle only if a non-trivial crash situ-
ation occurs; no data are recorded by the EDR under normal driving condi-
tions and no personal data (e.g., name, gender, age, and crash location) are
recorded. However, other parties, such as law enforcement, could combine
the EDR data with the type of personally identifying data routinely acquired
during a crash investigation. 
To read data recorded by an EDR, special equipment is required, and access
to the vehicle or the EDR is needed. In addition to the vehicle manufacturer,
other parties, such as law enforcement, that have the special equipment, can
read the information if they have access to the vehicle or the EDR.

● Disclosure of the EDR data

Toyota will not disclose the data recorded in an EDR to a third party except
when:
• An agreement from the vehicle’s owner (or the lessee for a leased vehi-

cle) is obtained

ment agency

• In response to an official request by the police, a court of law or a govern-

• For use by Toyota in a lawsuit
However, if necessary, Toyota may:
• Use the data for research on vehicle safety performance
• Disclose the data to a third party for research purposes without disclosing

information about the specific vehicle or vehicle owner

SEQUOIA_OM_USA_OM0C013U_19MY

11

Scrapping of your Toyota
The SRS airbag and seat belt pretensioner devices in your Toyota contain
explosive chemicals. If the vehicle is scrapped with the airbags and seat belt
pretensioners left as they are, this may cause an accident such as fire. Be
sure  to  have  the  systems  of  the  SRS  airbag  and  seat  belt  pretensioner
removed and disposed of by a qualified service shop or by your Toyota dealer
before you scrap your vehicle.
Perchlorate Material
Special handling may apply, 
See www.dtsc.ca.gov/hazardouswaste/perchlorate.
Your vehicle has  components that  may  contain perchlorate. These compo-
nents may include airbag, seat belt pretensioners, and wireless remote con-
trol batteries.

WARNING

■General precautions while driving

Driving under the influence: Never drive your vehicle when under the influ-
ence of alcohol or drugs that have impaired your ability to operate your vehi-
cle. Alcohol  and  certain  drugs  delay  reaction  time,  impair  judgment  and
reduce  coordination,  which  could  lead  to  an  accident  that  could  result  in
death or serious injury.
Defensive driving: Always drive defensively. Anticipate mistakes that other
drivers or pedestrians might make and be ready to avoid accidents.
Driver  distraction: Always  give  your  full  attention  to  driving. Anything  that
distracts the driver, such as adjusting controls, talking on a cellular phone or
reading can result in a collision with resulting death or serious injury to you,
your occupants or others.

■General precaution regarding children’s safety

Never leave children unattended in the vehicle, and never allow children to
have or use the key.
Children may be able to start the vehicle or shift the vehicle into neutral.
There is also a danger that children may injure themselves by playing with
the windows, the moon roof, or other features of the vehicle. In addition,
heat build-up or extremely cold temperatures inside the vehicle can be fatal
to children.

For safe driving

For  safe  driving,  adjust  the  seat  and  mirror  to  an  appropriate
position before driving.

Correct driving posture

Adjust  the  angle  of  the  seat-
back  so  that  you  are  sitting
straight  up  and  so  that  you  do
not  have  to  lean  forward  to
steer. (P. 120)
Adjust the seat so that you can
depress the pedals fully and so
that  your  arms  bend  slightly  at
the  elbow  when  gripping  the
steering wheel. (P. 120, 140)
Lock the head restraint in place with the center of the head restraint
closest to the top of your ears. (P. 138)
Wear the seat belt correctly. (P. 28)

Correct use of the seat belts
Make sure that all occupants are wearing their seat belts before driv-
ing the vehicle. (P. 28) 
Use  a  child  restraint  system  appropriate  for  the  child  until  the  child
becomes large enough to properly wear the vehicle’s seat belt. 
(P. 56)

SEQUOIA_OM_USA_OM0C013U_19MY

1-1. For safe use

27

Adjusting the mirrors
Make sure that you can see the rear of the vehicle clearly by adjusting
the inside and outside rear view mirrors properly. (P. 142, 145)

WARNING

Observe the following precautions. 
Failure to do so may result in death or serious injury.

●Do not adjust the position of the driver’s seat while driving. 

Doing so could cause the driver to lose control of the vehicle.

●Do not place a cushion between the driver or passenger and the seatback. 
A cushion may prevent correct posture from being achieved, and reduce
the effectiveness of the seat belt and head restraint.

●Do not place anything under the front seats. 

Objects  placed  under  the  front  seats  may  become  jammed  in  the  seat
tracks and stop the seat from locking in place. This may lead to an acci-
dent and the adjustment mechanism may also be damaged.

●Always observe the legal speed limit when driving on public roads.
●When driving over long distances, take regular breaks before you start to

feel tired. 
Also, if you feel tired or sleepy while driving, do not force yourself to con-
tinue driving and take a break immediately.

Seat belt pretensioners (front seats)
The  pretensioners  help  the  seat
belts to quickly restrain the occu-
pants by retracting the seat belts
when  the  vehicle  is  subjected  to
certain  types  of  severe  frontal  or
side collision, or a vehicle rollover.
The  pretensioners  do  not  activate
in  the  event  of  a  minor  frontal
impact,  a  minor  side  impact  or  a
rear impact.

■Emergency locking retractor (ELR)

The retractor will lock the belt during a sudden stop or on impact. It may also
lock if you lean forward too quickly. A slow, easy motion will allow the belt to
extend so that you can move around fully. 

■Automatic locking retractor (ALR)

When a passenger’s shoulder belt is completely extended and then retracted
even slightly, the belt is locked in that position and cannot be extended. This
feature is used to hold the child restraint system (CRS) firmly. To free the belt
again, fully retract the belt and then pull the belt out once more. (P. 60)

■Child seat belt usage

The seat belts of your vehicle were principally designed for persons of adult
size. 
●Use  a  child  restraint  system  appropriate  for  the  child,  until  the  child

becomes large enough to properly wear the vehicle’s seat belt. (P. 56)

●When the child becomes large enough to properly wear the vehicle’s seat

belt, follow the instructions regarding seat belt usage. (P. 28)
■Replacing the belt after the pretensioner has been activated

If the vehicle is involved in multiple collisions, the pretensioner will activate for
the first collision, but will not activate for the second or subsequent collisions.

WARNING

Observe the following precautions to reduce the risk of injury in the event of
sudden braking, sudden swerving or an accident.
Failure to do so may cause death or serious injury.
■Wearing a seat belt

●Ensure that all passengers wear a seat belt.
●Always wear a seat belt properly.
●Each seat belt should be used by one person only. Do not use a seat belt

for more than one person at once, including children.

●Toyota recommends that children be seated in the rear seat and always

use a seat belt and/or an appropriate child restraint system.

●To achieve a proper seating position, do not recline the seat more than
necessary. The seat belt is most effective when the occupants are sitting
up straight and well back in the seats.

●Do not wear the shoulder belt under your arm.
●Always wear your seat belt low and snug across your hips.

■Pregnant women

Obtain medical advice and wear the seat
belt in the proper way. (P. 28)
Women  who  are  pregnant  should  posi-
tion the lap belt as low as possible over
the  hips  in  the  same  manner  as  other
occupants,  extending  the  shoulder  belt
completely over the shoulder and avoid-
ing belt contact with the rounding of the
abdominal area.
If the seat belt is not worn properly, not
only  the  pregnant  woman,  but  also  the
fetus could suffer death or serious injury
as a result of sudden braking or a colli-
sion.

WARNING

■People suffering illness

Obtain medical advice and wear the seat belt in the proper way. (P. 28)

■When children are in the vehicle

Do not allow children to play with  the  seat  belt. If the seat belt becomes
twisted around a child’s neck, it may lead to choking or other serious injuries
that could result in death. 
If this occurs and the buckle cannot be unfastened, scissors should be used
to cut the belt.

■Seat belt pretensioners

●Do not place anything, such as a cushion, on the front passenger’s seat.
Doing so will disperse the passenger’s weight, which prevents the sensor
from detecting the passenger’s weight properly. As a result, the seat belt
pretensioner for the front passenger’s seat may not activate in the event of
a collision.

●If the pretensioner has activated, the SRS warning light will come on. In
that  case,  the  seat  belt  cannot  be  used  again  and  must  be  replaced  at
your Toyota dealer.

■Adjustable shoulder anchor

Always make sure the shoulder belt is positioned across the center of your
shoulder. The belt should be kept away from your neck, but not falling off
your shoulder. Failure to do so could reduce the amount of protection in an
accident and cause death or serious injuries in the event of a sudden stop,
sudden swerve or accident. (P. 31)

●Do not damage the seat belts by allowing the belt, plate, or buckle to be

●Inspect the seat belt system periodically. Check for cuts, fraying, and loose
parts. Do not use a damaged seat belt until it is replaced. Damaged seat
belts cannot protect an occupant from death or serious injury.

●Ensure that the belt and plate are locked and the belt is not twisted. 

If the seat belt does not function correctly, immediately contact your Toyota
dealer.

●Replace the seat assembly, including the belts, if your vehicle has been

involved in a serious accident, even if there is no obvious damage.

●Do not attempt to install, remove, modify, disassemble or dispose of the
seat belts. Have any necessary repairs carried out by your Toyota dealer.
Inappropriate handling may lead to incorrect operation.

■When using the third center seat belt
Do not use the third center seat belt with
either  buckle  released.  Fastening  only
one of the buckles may result in death or
serious injury in case of sudden braking
or a collision.

■Using a seat belt comfort guide (third center seat)

●Make sure the belt is not twisted and that it lies flat. The elastic cord must

be behind the belt and the guide must be on the front.

●To reduce the chance of injury in case of a sudden stop, sudden swerve or
accident while driving, remove and store the comfort guide in its pocket
when it is not in use.

●Always make sure the shoulder belt is positioned across the center of the
shoulder. The  belt  should  be  kept  away  from  the  neck,  and  should  not
slide off the shoulder. 
Failure to observe these precautions could reduce the effectiveness of the
seat belt in an accident, causing death or serious injury.

●Do not wear the seat belt extender if you can fasten the seat belt without

●Do not use the seat belt extender when installing a child restraint system
because the belt will not securely hold the child restraint system, increas-
ing the risk of death or serious injury in the event of an accident.

●The  personalized  extender  may  not  be  safe  on  another  vehicle,  when
used by another person, or at a different seating position other than the
one originally intended.

NOTICE

■When using a seat belt extender

When  releasing  the  seat  belt,  press  on  the  buckle  release  button  on  the
extender, not on the seat belt.
This helps prevent damage to the vehicle interior and the extender itself.

1-1. For safe use

Your vehicle is equipped with ADVANCED AIRBAGS designed based
on the US motor vehicle safety standards (FMVSS208). The airbag
sensor assembly (ECU) controls airbag deployment based on infor-
mation obtained from the sensors etc. shown in the system compo-
nents  diagram  above.  This  information  includes  crash  severity  and
occupant  information. As  the  airbags  deploy,  a  chemical  reaction  in
the inflators quickly fills the airbags with non-toxic gas to help restrain
the motion of the occupants.

WARNING

■SRS airbag precautions

Observe the following precautions regarding the SRS airbags. 
Failure to do so may cause death or serious injury.
●The  driver  and  all  passengers  in  the  vehicle  must  wear  their  seat  belts

properly. 
The SRS airbags are supplemental devices to be used with the seat belts.
●The  SRS  driver  airbag  deploys  with  considerable  force,  and  can  cause
death or serious injury especially if the driver is very close to the airbag.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) advises:
Since the risk zone for the driver’s airbag is the first 2 - 3 in. (50 - 75 mm)
of inflation, placing yourself 10 in. (250 mm) from your driver airbag pro-
vides you with a clear margin of safety. This distance is measured from
the center of the steering wheel to your breastbone. If you sit less than
10 in. (250 mm) away now, you can change your driving position in sev-
eral ways:
• Move your seat to the rear as far as you can while still reaching the ped-

als comfortably.

• Slightly recline the back of the seat. 

Although  vehicle  designs  vary,  many  drivers  can  achieve  the  10  in.
(250 mm) distance, even with the driver seat all the way forward, simply
by reclining the back of the seat somewhat. If reclining the back of your
seat makes it hard to see the road, raise yourself by using a firm, non-
slippery cushion, or raise the seat if your vehicle has that feature.

• If your steering wheel is adjustable, tilt it downward. This points the air-

bag toward your chest instead of your head and neck.

The seat should be adjusted as recommended by NHTSA above, while
still maintaining control of the foot pedals, steering wheel, and your view
of the instrument panel controls.

WARNING

■SRS airbag precautions

●If the seat belt extender has been con-
nected to the front seat belt buckles but
the seat belt extender has not also been
fastened  to  the  latch  plate  of  the  seat
belt,  the  SRS  front  airbags  will  judge
that the driver and front passenger are
wearing  the  seat  belt  even  though  the
seat  belt  has  not  been  connected.  In
this  case,  the  SRS  front  airbags  may
not  activate  correctly  in  a  collision,
resulting in death or serious injury in the
event of a collision. Be sure to wear the
seat belt with the seat belt extender.

●The SRS front passenger airbag also deploys with considerable force, and
can cause death or serious injury especially if the front passenger is very
close to the airbag. The front passenger seat should be as far from the air-
bag as possible with the seatback adjusted, so the front passenger sits
upright.

●Improperly seated and/or restrained infants and children can be killed or
seriously injured by a deploying airbag. An infant or child who is too small
to use a seat belt should be properly secured using a child restraint sys-
tem. Toyota strongly recommends that all infants and children be placed in
the rear seats of the vehicle and properly restrained. The rear seats are
safer for infants and children than the front passenger seat. (P. 56)

●Do  not  sit  on  the  edge  of  the  seat  or

lean against the dashboard.

WARNING

■SRS airbag precautions

●Do not allow a child to stand in front of
the SRS front passenger airbag unit or
sit on the knees of a front passenger.

●Do not allow the front seat occupants to

hold items on their knees.

●Do  not  lean  against  the  door,  the  roof
side rail or the front, side and rear pil-
lars.

●Do  not  allow  anyone  to  kneel  on  the
passenger seat toward the door or put
their head or hands outside the vehicle.

●Do  not attach anything to  or  lean any-
thing  against  areas  such  as  the  dash-
board,  steering  wheel  pad  and  lower
portion of the instrument panel. 
These  items  can  become  projectiles
when  the  SRS  driver,  front  passenger
and knee airbags deploy.

●Do not attach anything to areas such as
a  door,  windshield  glass,  side  door
glass,  front  or  rear  pillar,  roof  side  rail
and assist grip.

WARNING

■SRS airbag precautions

●Do not attach any heavy, sharp or hard
objects  such  as  keys  and  accessories
to the key. The objects may restrict the
SRS  knee  airbag  inflation  or  be  thrust
into the driver’s seat area by the force
of the deploying airbag, thus causing a
danger.

●Do not hang coat hangers or other hard objects on the coat hooks. All of
these  items  could  become  projectiles  and  may  cause  death  or  serious
injury, should the SRS curtain shield airbags deploy.

●If a vinyl cover is put on the area where the SRS knee airbag will deploy,

be sure to remove it.

●Do not use seat accessories which cover the parts where the SRS side
airbags  inflate  as  they  may  interfere  with  inflation  of  the  SRS  airbags.
Such accessories may prevent the side airbags from activating correctly,
disable the system or cause the side airbags to inflate accidentally, result-
ing in death or serious injury.

●Do not strike or apply significant levels of force to the area of the SRS air-

bag components. 
Doing so can cause the SRS airbags to malfunction.

●Do not touch any of the component parts immediately after the SRS air-

bags have deployed (inflated) as they may be hot.

●If breathing becomes difficult after the SRS airbags have deployed, open a
door or window to allow fresh air in, or leave the vehicle if it is safe to do
so. Wash off any residue as soon as possible to prevent skin irritation. 

●If the areas where the SRS airbags are stored, such as the steering wheel
pad  and  front  and  rear  pillar  garnishes,  are  damaged  or  cracked,  have
them replaced by your Toyota dealer.

●Do not place anything, such as a cushion, on the front passenger’s seat.
Doing so will disperse the passenger’s weight, which prevents the sensor
from detecting the passenger’s weight properly. As a result, the SRS front
airbags for the front passenger may not deploy in the event of a collision.

WARNING

■Modification and disposal of SRS airbag system components

Do not dispose of your vehicle or perform any of the following modifications
without consulting your Toyota dealer. The SRS airbags may malfunction or
deploy (inflate) accidentally, causing death or serious injury.
●Installation, removal, disassembly and repair of the SRS airbags
●Repairs,  modifications,  removal  or  replacement  of  the  steering  wheel,
instrument panel, dashboard, seats or seat upholstery, front, side and rear
pillars or roof side rails

●Repairs or modifications of the front fender, front bumper, or side of the

occupant compartment

●Installation  of a  grille guard (bull bars, kangaroo bar,  etc.),  snow plows,

winches or roof luggage carrier.

●Modifications to the vehicle’s suspension system
●Installation of electronic devices such as mobile two-way radios and CD

players

●Modifications to your vehicle for a person with a physical disability

■If the SRS airbags deploy (inflate)

●Slight abrasions, burns, bruising, etc., may be sustained from SRS airbags,

due to the extremely high speed deployment (inflation) by hot gases.

●A loud noise and white powder will be emitted.
●Parts of the airbag module (steering wheel hub, airbag cover and inflator) as
well as the front seats, parts of the front and rear pillars, and roof side rails,
may be hot for several minutes. The airbag itself may also be hot.

●The windshield may crack.

■SRS airbag deployment conditions (SRS front airbags)

●The SRS front airbags will deploy in the event of an impact that exceeds the
set threshold level (the level of force corresponding to an approximately 12 -
18 mph [20 - 30 km/h] frontal collision with a fixed wall that does not move or
deform).
However, this threshold velocity will be considerably higher in the following
situations:
• If  the  vehicle  strikes  an  object,  such  as  a  parked  vehicle  or  sign  pole,

which can move or deform on impact

• If the vehicle is involved in an underride collision, such as a collision in
which the front of the vehicle “underrides”, or goes under, the bed of a
truck

●The SRS front airbags for the front passenger will not activate if there is no
passenger sitting in the front passenger seat. However, the SRS front air-
bags for the front passenger may deploy if luggage is put in the seat, even if
the seat is unoccupied.

■SRS airbag deployment conditions (SRS side and curtain shield airbags)
●The  SRS  side  and  curtain  shield  airbags  will  deploy  in  the  event  of  an
impact that exceeds the set threshold level (the level of force corresponding
to the impact force produced by an approximately 3300 lb. [1500 kg] vehicle
colliding with the vehicle cabin from a direction perpendicular to the vehicle
orientation at an approximate speed of 12 - 18 mph [20 - 30 km/h]).

●Both SRS curtain shield airbags will deploy in the event of vehicle rollover.
●Both SRS curtain shield airbags will deploy in the event of a severe frontal

collision.

■Conditions under which the SRS airbags may deploy (inflate), other than

a collision 
The SRS front airbags, SRS curtain shield airbags may also deploy if a seri-
ous  impact  occurs  to  the  underside  of  your  vehicle.  Some  examples  are
shown in the illustration.
●Hitting a curb, edge of pavement or hard

surface

●Falling into or jumping over a deep hole
●Landing hard or falling

The SRS curtain shield airbags may also deploy under the situations shown
in the illustration.
●The angle of vehicle tip-up is marginal.
●The vehicle skids and hits a curb stone.

■Types of collisions that may not deploy the SRS airbags (SRS front air-

bags)
The SRS front airbags do not generally inflate if the vehicle is involved in a
side or rear collision, if it rolls over, or if it is involved in a low-speed frontal
collision.  But,  whenever  a  collision  of  any  type  causes  sufficient  forward
deceleration of the vehicle, deployment of the SRS front airbags may occur.
●Collision from the side
●Collision from the rear
●Vehicle rollover

SEQUOIA_OM_USA_OM0C013U_19MY

47
■Types of collisions that may not deploy the SRS airbags (SRS side and

curtain shield airbags)
The  SRS  side  and  curtain  shield  airbags  may  not  activate  if  the  vehicle  is
subjected to a collision from the side at certain angles, or a collision to the
side of the vehicle body other than the passenger compartment.
●Collision  from  the  side  to  the  vehicle
body other than the passenger compart-
ment

●Collision from the side at an angle

The SRS side airbags do not generally inflate if the vehicle is involved in a
frontal or rear collision, if it rolls over, or if it is involved in a low-speed side
collision.
●Collision from the front
●Collision from the rear
●Vehicle rollover

WARNING

■Front passenger occupant classification system precautions

Observe the following precautions regarding the front passenger occupant
classification system. 
Failure to do so may cause death or serious injury.
●Wear the seat belt properly.
●Make sure the front passenger’s seat belt plate has not been left inserted

into the buckle before someone sits in the front passenger seat.

●Make sure the “AIR BAG OFF” indicator light is not illuminated when using
the seat belt extender for the front passenger seat. If the “AIR BAG OFF”
indicator light is illuminated, disconnect the extender tongue from the seat
belt buckle, and reconnect the seat belt. Reconnect the seat belt extender
after making sure the “AIR BAG ON” indicator light is illuminated. If you
use the seat belt extender while the “AIR BAG OFF” indicator light is illumi-
nated,  the  SRS  airbags  for  the  front  passenger  will  not  activate,  which
could cause death or serious injury in the event of a collision.

●Do not apply a heavy load to the front passenger seat or equipment (e.g.

seatback pocket).

●Do not put weight on the front passenger seat by putting your hands or

feet on the front passenger seat seatback from the rear passenger seat.

●Do not let a rear passenger lift the front passenger seat with their feet or

press on the seatback with their legs.

●Do not put objects under the front passenger seat.

WARNING

■Front passenger occupant classification system precautions

●Do not recline the front passenger seatback so far that it touches a rear
seat. This may cause the “AIR BAG OFF” indicator light to be illuminated,
which indicates that the SRS airbags for the front passenger will not acti-
vate in the event of a severe accident. If the seatback touches the rear
seat, return the seatback to a position where it does not touch the rear
seat. Keep the front passenger seatback as upright as possible when the
vehicle  is  moving.  Reclining  the  seatback  excessively  may  lessen  the
effectiveness of the seat belt system.

●If an adult sits in the front passenger seat, the “AIR BAG ON” indicator
light is illuminated. If the “AIR BAG OFF” indicator is illuminated, ask the
passenger to sit up straight, well back in the seat, feet on the floor, and
with  the  seat  belt  worn  correctly.  If  the  “AIR  BAG  OFF”  indicator  still
remains illuminated, either ask the passenger to move to the rear seat, or
if that is not possible, move the front passenger seat fully rearward.

●When it is unavoidable to install a forward-facing child restraint system on
the front passenger seat, install the child restraint system on the front pas-
senger seat in the proper order. (P. 60)
●Do not modify or remove the front seats.
●Do not kick the front passenger seat or subject it to severe impact. Other-
wise, the SRS warning light may come on to indicate a malfunction of the
front passenger occupant classification system. In this case, contact your
Toyota dealer immediately.

●Child restraint systems installed on the second seat should not contact the

front seatbacks.

●Do not use a seat accessory, such as a cushion and seat cover, that cov-

ers the seat cushion surface.

●Do not modify or replace the upholstery of the front seat.

Safety information for children

Observe the following precautions when children are in the vehi-
cle.
Use a child restraint system appropriate for the child, until the
child becomes large enough to properly wear the vehicle’s seat
belt.

● It is recommended that children sit in the rear seats to avoid acci-

dental contact with the shift lever, wiper lever, etc.

● Use the rear door child-protector lock or the window lock switch to
avoid  children  opening  the  door  while  driving  or  operating  the
power window accidentally.

● Do  not  let  small  children  operate  equipment  which  may  catch  or
pinch  body  parts,  such  as  the  power  window,  hood,  back  door,
seats, etc.

WARNING

Never leave children unattended in the vehicle, and never allow children to
have or use the key.
Children may be able to start the vehicle or shift the vehicle into neutral.
There is also a danger that children may injure themselves by playing with
the windows, the moon roof or other features of the vehicle. In addition, heat
build-up or extremely cold temperatures inside the vehicle can be fatal to
children.

Child restraint systems

A child restraint system for a small child or baby must itself be
properly restrained on the seat with the LATCH anchors or the
lap portion of the lap/shoulder belt.
The laws of all 50 states of the U.S.A. and Canada now require
the use of child restraint systems.

Points to remember
Studies have shown that installing a child restraint on a rear seat is
much safer than installing one on the front passenger seat.
● Choose a child restraint system that suits your vehicle and is appro-

priate to the age and size of the child. 

● For installation details, follow the instructions provided with the child

restraint system. 
General installation instructions are provided in this manual. 
(P. 60)

■Selecting an appropriate child restraint system

●Use a child restraint system appropriate for the child until the child becomes

large enough to properly wear the vehicle’s seat belt.

●If the child is too large for a child restraint system, sit the child on a rear seat

and use the vehicle’s seat belt. (P. 28)

SEQUOIA_OM_USA_OM0C013U_19MY

WARNING

■Child restraint precautions

●For effective protection in automobile accidents and sudden stops, a child
must  be  properly  restrained,  using  a  seat  belt  or  child  restraint  system
depending  on  the  age  and  size  of  the  child.  Holding  a  child  in  your  or
someone else’s arms is not a substitute for a child restraint system. In an
accident, the child can be crushed against the windshield or between the
holder and the interior of the vehicle.

●Toyota strongly urges the use of a proper child restraint system that con-
forms to the size of the child, installed on the rear seat. According to acci-
dent statistics, the child is safer when properly restrained in the rear seat
than in the front seat.

●Never  install  a  rear-facing  child  restraint  system  on  the  front  passenger

seat even if the “AIR BAG OFF” indicator light is illuminated. 
In the event of an accident, the force of the rapid inflation of the front pas-
senger airbag can cause death or serious injury to the child if the rear-fac-
ing child restraint system is installed on the front passenger seat.

●A forward-facing child restraint system may be installed on the front pas-
senger  seat  only  when  it  is  unavoidable. A  child  restraint  system  that
requires a top tether strap should not be used in the front passenger seat
since  there  is  no  top  tether  strap  anchor  for  the  front  passenger  seat.
Adjust the seatback as upright as possible and always move the seat as
far back as possible even if the “AIR BAG OFF” indicator light  is illumi-
nated, because the front passenger airbag could inflate with considerable
speed and force. Otherwise, the child may be killed or seriously injured.

●Do not use the seat belt extender when installing a child restraint system
on the front or rear passenger seat. If installing a child restraint system
with the seat belt extender connected to the seat belt, the seat belt will not
securely hold the child restraint system, which could cause death or seri-
ous injury to the child or other passengers in the event of an accident.

SEQUOIA_OM_USA_OM0C013U_19MY

1-1. For safe use

WARNING

●Do  not  allow  the  child  to  lean  his/her  head  or  any  part  of  his/her  body
against the door or the area of the seat, front and rear pillars or roof side
rails from which the SRS side airbags or SRS curtain shield airbags deploy
even if the child is seated in the child restraint system. It is dangerous if
the  SRS  side  airbags  and  curtain  shield  airbags  inflate,  and  the  impact
could cause death or serious injury to the child.

●Make sure you have complied with all installation instructions provided by
the child restraint manufacturer and that the system is properly secured. If
it is not secured properly, it may cause death or serious injury to the child
in the event of a sudden stop, sudden swerve or accident.

■When children are in the vehicle

Do not allow children to play with  the  seat  belt. If the seat belt becomes
twisted around a child’s neck, it may lead to choking or other serious injuries
that could result in death.
If this occurs and the buckle cannot be unfastened, scissors should be used
to cut the belt.

■When the child restraint system is not in use

●Keep the child restraint system properly secured on the seat even if it is
not in use. Do not store the child restraint system unsecured in the pas-
senger compartment.

●If it is necessary to detach the child restraint system, remove it from the
vehicle or store it securely in the luggage compartment. This will prevent it
from injuring passengers in the event of a sudden stop, sudden swerve or
accident.

WARNING

■When installing a booster seat 

To prevent the belt from going into ALR lock mode, do not fully extend the
shoulder belt. ALR mode causes the belt to tighten only. This could cause
injury or discomfort to the child. (P. 32)

■When installing a child restraint system

Follow the directions given in the child restraint system installation manual
and fix the child restraint system securely in place. 
If the child restraint system is not correctly fixed in place, the child or other
passengers may be seriously injured or even killed in the event of a sudden
braking or an accident.
●If  the  driver’s  seat  interferes  with  the
child  restraint  system  and  prevents  it
from being attached correctly, attach the
child  restraint system to the  right-hand
rear seat.

●Adjust the front passenger seat so that
it  does  not  interfere  with  the  child
restraint system.

●Only put a forward-facing child restraint
system on the front seat when unavoid-
able.  When  installing  a  forward-facing
child restraint system on the front pas-
senger seat, move the seat as far back
as possible even if the “AIR BAG OFF”
indicator  light  is  illuminated.  Failure  to
do  so  may  result  in  death  or  serious
injury if the airbags deploy (inflate).

●Vehicles with bench type second seats: When installing a child  restraint
system on the second seat, adjust both seat cushions to the same position
and  align  both  seatbacks  at  the  same  angle.  The  seatbacks  must  be
adjusted to the same angle. Otherwise, the child restraint system cannot
be securely restrained and this may cause death or serious injuries in the
event of sudden braking, sudden swerving or an accident.

WARNING

●When  installing  a  child  restraint  system  on  the  third  center  seat,  adjust
both seatbacks at the same angle. The seatbacks must be adjusted to the
same  angle.  Otherwise,  the  child  restraint  system  cannot  be  securely
restrained and this may cause death or serious injuries in the event of sud-
den braking, sudden swerving or an accident.

■When installing a child restraint system

●When a booster seat is installed, always ensure that the shoulder belt is
positioned  across  the  center  of  the  child’s  shoulder. The  belt  should  be
kept away from the child’s neck, but not so that it could fall off the child’s
shoulder. Failing to do so may result in death or serious injury in the event
of an accident or a sudden braking.

●Ensure that the belt and plate are securely locked and the seat belt is not

twisted.

●Shake the child restraint system left and right, and forward and backward

to ensure that it has been securely installed.

●After securing a child restraint system, never adjust the seat.
●Follow  all  installation  instructions  provided  by  the  child  restraint  system

manufacturer.

●When securing some types of child restraint systems in second or third
seats, it may not be possible to properly use the seat belts in positions
next to the child restraint without interfering with it or affecting seat belt
effectiveness. Be sure your seat belt fits snugly across your shoulder and
low on your hips. If it does not, or if it interferes with the child restraint,
move to a different position.

■When installing a child restraint system (vehicles with bench type sec-

ond seat)
Observe the following precautions.
Failure to do so may cause death or serious injury to the child or other pas-
sengers in the event of a sudden stop or accident.
●When  installing  the  child  restraint  system  onto  the  second  center  seat,

secure it so as not interfere with the front console box.

●Do not change the posture and position of the outside second seat once

the child restraint system has been secured to the second center seat.

WARNING

■Do not use a seat belt extender

If a seat belt extender is used when installing a child restraint system, the
seat belt will not securely hold the child restraint system, which could cause
death or serious injury to the child or other passengers in the event of a sud-
den braking, sudden swerving or an accident.

■To correctly attach a child restraint system to the anchors

When using the LATCH anchors, be sure that there are no foreign objects
around  the  anchors  and  that  the  seat  belt  is  not  caught  behind the  child
restraint system. Make sure the child restraint system is securely attached,
or it may cause death or serious injury to the child or other passengers in
the event of a sudden braking or an accident.

Exhaust gas precautions

Harmful  substance  to  the  human  body  is  included  in  exhaust
gases if inhaled.

WARNING

Exhaust gases contain harmful carbon monoxide (CO), which is colorless and
odorless. Observe the following precautions. 
Failure to do so may cause exhaust gases to enter the vehicle and may lead
to an accident caused by light-headedness, or may lead to death or a serious
health hazard.
■Important points while driving

●Keep the back door closed.
●If  you  smell  exhaust  gases  in  the  vehicle  even  when  the  back  door  is
closed, open the windows and have the vehicle inspected at your Toyota
dealer as soon as possible.

■When parking

garage, stop the engine.

●If  the  vehicle  is  in  a  poorly  ventilated  area  or  a  closed  area,  such  as  a

●Do not leave the vehicle with the engine on for a long time. 

If such a situation cannot be avoided, park the vehicle in an open space
and ensure that exhaust fumes do not enter the vehicle interior.

●Do not leave the engine running in an area with snow build-up, or where it
is snowing. If snowbanks build up around the vehicle while the engine is
running, exhaust gases may collect and enter the vehicle.

■Exhaust pipe

The exhaust system needs to be checked periodically. If there is a hole or
crack caused by corrosion, damage to a joint or abnormal exhaust noise, be
sure to have the vehicle inspected and repaired by your Toyota dealer.

■The information display at low temperatures

Allow the interior of the vehicle to warm up before using the liquid crystal
information display. At extremely low temperatures, the information display
monitor may respond slowly, and display changes may be delayed. 
For example, there is a lag between the driver’s shifting and the new gear
number appearing on the display. This lag could cause the driver to down-
shift  again,  causing  rapid  and  excessive  engine  braking  and  possibly  an
accident resulting in personal death or injury.

WARNING

NOTICE

■To prevent damage to the engine and its components

●Do not let the indicator needle of the tachometer enter the red zone, which

indicates the maximum engine speed.

●The engine may be overheating if the engine coolant temperature gauge is
in the red zone (H). In this case, immediately stop the vehicle in a safe
place, and check the engine after it has cooled completely. (P. 484)

■Voltmeter

When the voltmeter indicates 19 V or higher or 9 V or lower while the engine
is running, there may be a battery or charging system malfunction. Have the
vehicle inspected at your Toyota dealer.

■Engine oil pressure gauge

When the value of the engine oil pressure gauge drops while the engine is
running, stop the vehicle in a safe place immediately and check the amount

the back door is about to open or close.

●Use caution when opening or closing the back door in windy weather as it

may move abruptly in strong wind.

●The back door may suddenly shut if it is
not  opened  fully.  It  is  more  difficult  to
open  or  close  the  back  door  on  an
incline  than  on  a  level  surface,  so
beware  of  the  back  door  unexpectedly
opening or closing by itself. Make sure
that  the  back  door  is  fully  open  and
secure  before  using  the  luggage  com-
partment. 

●When closing the back door, take extra
care to prevent your fingers, etc., from
being caught.

●When closing the back door, make sure
to press it lightly on its outer surface. If
the back door handle or back door strap
is  used  to  fully  close  the  back  door,  it
may  result  in  hands  or  arms  being

Linked  mirror  function  when  reversing  (vehicles  with  driving
position memory)
When the mirror select switch is in the “L” or “R” position, the outside
rear view mirrors will automatically angle downwards when the vehicle
is reversing in order to give a better view of the ground.
To disable this function, move the mirror select switch to the neutral
position (between “L” and “R”).
■ Adjusting the mirror angle when the vehicle is reversing

With the shift lever in R, adjust the mirror angle at a desired posi-
tion. 
The adjusted angle will be memorized and the mirror will automati-
cally tilt to the memorized angle whenever the shift lever is shifted
to R.

The memorized downward tilt position of the mirror is linked to the nor-
mal position (angle adjusted with the shift lever in other than R). There-
fore, if the normal position is changed after adjustment, the tilt position
will  also  change.  When  the  normal  position  is  changed,  readjust  the
angle in reversing.

■Mirror angle can be adjusted when

The engine switch is in the “ACC” or “ON” position.

■When the mirrors are fogged up (vehicles with outside rear view mirror

defoggers)
The outside rear view mirrors can be cleared using the mirror defoggers. Turn
on the rear window defogger to turn on the outside rear view mirror defog-
gers. (P. 323)

■Auto anti-glare function (if equipped)

When the anti-glare inside rear view mirror is set to auto mode, the outside
rear  view  mirrors  will  activate  in  conjunction  with  the  anti-glare  inside  rear
view mirror to reduce reflected light. (P. 142)

■Automatic adjustment of the mirror angle (vehicles with driving position

memory)
A desired mirror face angle can be entered to memory and recalled automati-
cally by the driving position memory. (P. 133)

●For the first 1000 miles (1600 km):

• Do not drive at extremely high speeds.
• Avoid sudden acceleration.
• Do not drive continuously in low gears.
• Do not drive at a constant speed for extended periods.

■Drum-in-disc type parking brake system

Your vehicle has a drum-in-disc type parking brake system. This type of brake
system needs bedding-down of the brake shoes periodically or whenever the
parking brake shoes and/or drum are replaced. Have your Toyota dealer per-
form the bedding down operation.

■Operating your vehicle in a foreign country

Comply with the relevant vehicle registration laws and confirm the availability
of the correct fuel. (P. 501)

WARNING

Observe the following precautions. 
Failure to do so may result in death or serious injury.
■When starting the vehicle

Always keep your foot on the brake pedal while stopped with the engine
running. This prevents the vehicle from creeping.

■When driving the vehicle

●Do not drive if you are unfamiliar with the location of the brake and accel-

erator pedals to avoid depressing the wrong pedal. 
• Accidentally  depressing  the  accelerator  pedal  instead  of  the  brake

pedal will result in sudden acceleration that may lead to an accident.

• When backing up, you may twist your body around, leading to difficulty

in operating the pedals. Make sure to operate the pedals properly.

• Make  sure  to  keep  a  correct  driving  posture  even  when  moving  the
vehicle only slightly. This allows you to depress the brake and accelera-
tor pedals properly.

• Depress  the  brake  pedal  using  your  right  foot.  Depressing  the  brake
pedal using your left foot may delay response in an emergency, result-
ing in an accident.

●Do not drive the vehicle over or stop the vehicle near flammable materials.
The exhaust system and exhaust gases can be extremely hot. These hot
parts may cause a fire if there is any flammable material nearby.

WARNING

Observe the following precautions. 
Failure to do so may result in death or serious injury.
■When driving the vehicle

●During normal driving, do not turn off the engine. Turning the engine off
while  driving  will  not  cause  loss  of  steering  or  braking  control,  but  the
power assist to these systems will be lost. This will make it more difficult to
steer and brake, so you should pull over and stop the vehicle as soon as it
is safe to do so. 
However, in the event of an emergency, such as if it becomes impossible
to stop the vehicle in the normal way: P. 439

●Use  engine  braking  (downshift)  to  maintain  a  safe  speed  when  driving

down a steep hill. 
Using the brakes continuously may cause the brakes to overheat and lose
effectiveness. (P. 201)

●Do not adjust the positions of the steering wheel, the seat, or the inside or

outside rear view mirrors while driving.
Doing so may result in a loss of vehicle control.

●Always check that all passengers’ arms, heads or other parts of their body

are not outside the vehicle.

●Do not drive in excess of the speed limit. Even if the legal speed limit per-
mits it, do not drive over 85 mph (140 km/h) unless your vehicle has high-
speed capability tires. Driving over 85 mph (140 km/h) may result in tire
failure, loss of control and possible injury. Be sure to consult a tire dealer
to determine whether the tires on your vehicle are high-speed capability
tires or not before driving at such speeds.

●On  vehicles  with  electronically  modulated  air  suspension,  if  you  drive
through deep water over about 20 in. (500 mm) in depth, put the vehicle
height in the “HI” mode using the height control switch and then change to
manual mode by pushing the height control mode select switch. Drive your
vehicle at 18 mph (30 km/h) or less. Do not drive through water deeper
than about 28 in. (700 mm) even if the vehicle height is in “HI” mode.

WARNING

Observe the following precautions. 
Failure to do so may result in death or serious injury.
■When driving on slippery road surfaces

●Sudden  braking,  acceleration  and  steering  may  cause  tire  slippage  and

reduce your ability to control the vehicle, resulting in an accident.

●Sudden acceleration, engine braking due to shifting, or changes in engine

speed could cause the vehicle to skid, resulting in an accident.

●After  driving  through  a  puddle,  lightly  depress  the  brake  pedal  to  make
sure that the brakes are functioning properly. Wet brake pads may prevent
the brakes from functioning properly. If the brakes on only one side are wet
and not functioning properly, steering control may be affected, resulting in
an accident.

■When shifting the shift lever

●Do not let the vehicle roll backward while the shift lever is in a driving posi-

tion, or roll forward while the shift lever is in R.
Doing so may cause the engine to stall or lead to poor brake and steering
performance, resulting in an accident or damage to the vehicle.

●Do not shift the shift lever to P while the vehicle is moving. 

Doing so can damage the transmission and may result in a loss of vehicle
control.

●Do not shift the shift lever to R while the vehicle is moving forward. 

Doing so can damage the transmission and may result in a loss of vehicle
control.

●Do not shift the shift lever to a driving position while the vehicle is moving

backward. 
Doing so can damage the transmission and may result in a loss of vehicle
control.

●Moving the shift lever to N while the vehicle is moving will disengage the
engine from the transmission. Engine braking is not available when N is
selected.

●Be careful not to shift the shift lever with the accelerator pedal depressed.
Shifting the shift lever to a gear other than P or N may lead to unexpected
rapid acceleration of the vehicle that may cause an accident and result in
death or serious injury.

WARNING

Observe the following precautions. 
Failure to do so may result in death or serious injury.
■If you hear a squealing or scraping noise (brake pad wear limit indica-

tors)
Have the brake pads checked and replaced by your Toyota dealer as soon
as possible. 
Rotor damage may result if the pads are not replaced when needed.
It is dangerous to drive the vehicle when the wear limits of the brake pads
and/or those of the brake discs are exceeded.

■When the vehicle is stopped

●Do not race the engine.

If the vehicle is in any gear other than P or N, the vehicle may accelerate
suddenly and unexpectedly, causing an accident.

●In order to prevent accidents due to the vehicle rolling away, always keep
depressing  the  brake  pedal  while  the  engine  is  running,  and  apply  the
parking brake as necessary.

●If the vehicle is stopped on an incline, in order to prevent accidents caused
by the vehicle rolling forward or backward, always depress the brake pedal
and securely apply the parking brake as needed.

●Avoid revving or racing the engine. 

Running the engine at high speed while the vehicle is stopped may cause
the exhaust system to overheat, which could result in a fire if combustible
material is nearby.

●Do not leave glasses, cigarette lighters, spray cans, or soft drink cans in

the vehicle when it is in the sun.
Doing so may result in the following:
• Gas may leak from a cigarette lighter or spray can, and may lead to a

• The temperature inside the vehicle may cause the plastic lenses and

plastic material of glasses to deform or crack.

• Soft  drink  cans  may  fracture,  causing  the  contents  to  spray  over  the
interior of the vehicle, and may also cause a short circuit in the vehicle’s
electrical components.

●Do not leave cigarette lighters in the vehicle. If a cigarette lighter is in a
place such as the glove box or on the floor, it may be lit accidentally when
luggage is loaded or the seat is adjusted, causing a fire.

●Do not attach adhesive discs to the windshield or windows. Do not place
containers such as air fresheners on the instrument panel or dashboard.
Adhesive discs or containers may act as lenses, causing a fire in the vehi-
cle.

●Do not leave a door or window open if the curved glass is coated with a
metallized film such as a silver-colored one. Reflected sunlight may cause
the glass to act as a lens, causing a fire.

●Always apply the parking brake, shift the shift lever to P, stop the engine

and lock the vehicle.
Do not leave the vehicle unattended while the engine is running.
If the vehicle is parked with the shift lever in P but the parking brake is not
set, the vehicle may start to move, possibly leading to an accident.

●Do not touch the exhaust pipes while the engine is running or immediately

after turning the engine off.
Doing so may cause burns.

●4WD models: If the shift lever is moved before the “4LO” indicator turns
on/off, the transfer mode may not be shifted completely. The transfer mode
disengages  both  the  front  and  rear  driveshafts  from  the  powertrain  and
allows the vehicle to move regardless of the shift position. (At this time, the
indicator blinks and the buzzer sounds.)
Therefore, the vehicle is free to roll even if the automatic transmission is in
P. You or someone else could be seriously injured. You must complete the
shifting of the transfer mode. (P. 295)

WARNING

Observe the following precautions. 
Failure to do so may result in death or serious injury.
■When taking a nap in the vehicle

Always  turn  the  engine  off.  Otherwise,  if  you  accidentally  move  the  shift
lever or depress the accelerator pedal, this could cause an accident or fire
due to engine overheating. Additionally, if the vehicle is parked in a poorly
ventilated area, exhaust gases may collect and enter the vehicle, leading to
death or a serious health hazard.

■When braking

●When the brakes are wet, drive more cautiously.

Braking distance increases when the brakes are wet, and this may cause
one side of the vehicle to brake differently than the other side. Also, the
parking brake may not securely hold the vehicle.

●If the brake booster device does not operate, do not follow other vehicles

closely and avoid hills or sharp turns that require braking. 
In  this  case,  braking  is  still  possible,  but  the  brake  pedal  should  be
depressed more firmly than usual. Also, the braking distance will increase.
Have your brakes fixed immediately.

●Do not pump the brake pedal if the engine stalls. 

Each push on the brake pedal uses up the reserve for the power-assisted
brakes.

●The brake system consists of 2 individual hydraulic systems; if one of the
systems  fails,  the  other  will  still  operate.  In  this  case,  the  brake  pedal
should be depressed more firmly than usual and the braking distance will
increase.
If  this  happens,  do  not  continue  to  drive  the  vehicle.  Have  your  brakes
fixed immediately.

■If the vehicle becomes stuck (4WD models)

Do not spin the wheels excessively when any of the tires is up in the air, or
the vehicle is stuck in sand, mud, etc. This may damage the driveline com-
ponents or propel the vehicle forward or backward, causing an accident.

NOTICE

■When driving the vehicle

●Do not depress the accelerator and brake pedals at the same time during

driving, as this may restrain the engine output.

●Do  not  use  the  accelerator  pedal  or  depress  the  accelerator  and  brake

pedals at the same time to hold the vehicle on a hill.

■When parking the vehicle

Always set the parking brake, and shift the shift lever to P. Failure to do so
may cause the vehicle to move or the vehicle may accelerate suddenly if
the accelerator pedal is accidentally depressed.

■Avoiding damage to vehicle parts

●Do not turn the steering wheel fully in either direction and hold it there for

an extended period of time. 
Doing so may damage the power steering pump.

●When driving over bumps in the road, drive as slowly as possible to avoid

damaging the wheels, underside of the vehicle, etc. 

■If you get a flat tire while driving

A flat or damaged tire may cause the following situations. Hold the steering
wheel firmly and gradually depress the brake pedal to slow down the vehi-
cle.
●It may be difficult to control your vehicle.
●The vehicle will make abnormal sounds or vibrations.
●The vehicle will behave abnormally.

Capacity and distribution
Cargo capacity depends on the total weight of the occupants.
(Cargo capacity) = (Total load capacity) — (Total weight of occupants)
Steps for Determining Correct Load Limit —
(1) Locate  the  statement  “The  combined  weight  of  occupants  and
cargo should never exceed XXX kg or XXX lbs.” on your vehicle’s
placard. 

(2) Determine the combined weight of the driver and passengers that

will be riding in your vehicle. 

(3) Subtract the combined weight of the driver and passengers from

XXX kg or XXX lbs.

(4) The resulting figure equals the available amount of cargo and lug-

gage load capacity. 
For example, if the “XXX” amount equals 1400 lbs. and there will
be five 150 lb passengers in your vehicle, the amount of available
cargo and luggage load capacity is 650 lbs. (1400  750 (5150) =
650 lbs.) 

(5) Determine the combined weight of luggage and cargo being loaded
on  the  vehicle. That  weight  may  not  safely  exceed  the  available
cargo and luggage load capacity calculated in Step 4. 

(6) If your vehicle will be towing a trailer, load from your trailer will be
transferred to your vehicle. Consult this manual to determine how
this reduces the available cargo and luggage load capacity of your
vehicle.(P. 177)

load  capacity 

(vehicle

When  2  people  with  the  combined weight  of A  lb.  (kg)  are riding  in
your vehicle, which has a total load capacity (vehicle capacity weight)
of B lb. (kg), the available amount of cargo and luggage load capacity
will be C lb. (kg) as follows: 
B*2 lb. (kg) - A*1 lb. (kg) = C*3 lb. (kg)
*1: A = Weight of people 
*2: B = Total load capacity 
*3: C = Available cargo and luggage load

In this condition, if 3 more passengers with the combined weight of D
lb. (kg) get on, the available cargo and luggage load will be reduced E
lb. (kg) as follows:

C lb. (kg) - D*4 lb. (kg) = E*5 lb. (kg)
*4: D = Additional weight of people 
*5: E = Available cargo and luggage load
As  shown  in  the  example  above,  if  the  number  of  occupants
increases, the cargo and luggage load will be reduced by an amount
that equals the increased weight due to the additional occupants. In
other  words,  if  an  increase  in  the  number  of  occupants  causes  an
excess of the total load capacity (combined weight of occupants plus
cargo and luggage load), you must reduce the cargo and luggage on
your vehicle.

Trailer towing

Your vehicle is designed primarily as a passenger-and-load-car-
rying  vehicle.  Towing  a  trailer  can  have  an  adverse  impact  on
handling,  performance,  braking,  durability,  and  fuel  consump-
tion. For your safety and the safety of others, you must not over-
load your vehicle or trailer. You must also ensure that you are
using appropriate towing equipment, that the towing equipment
has  been  installed  correctly  and  used  properly,  and  that  you
employ the requisite driving habits.
Vehicle-trailer stability and braking performance are affected by
trailer  stability,  brake  performance  and  setting,  trailer  brakes,
the hitch and hitch systems (if equipped).
To tow a trailer safely, use extreme care and drive the vehicle in
accordance  with  your  trailer’s  characteristics  and  operating
conditions.
Toyota  warranties  do  not  apply  to  damage  or  malfunction
caused by towing a trailer for commercial purposes.

Trailer towing tips
Your vehicle will handle differently when towing a trailer. Help to avoid
an accident, death or serious injury, keep the following in mind when
towing:
● Speed limits for towing a trailer vary by state or province. Do not

exceed the posted towing speed limit.

● Toyota recommends that the vehicle-trailer speed limit is 65 mph
(104 km/h) on a flat, straight, dry road. Do not exceed this limit, the
posted towing speed limit or the speed limit for your trailer as set
forth in your trailer owner’s manual, whichever is lowest. Instability
of the towing vehicle-trailer combination (trailer sway) increases as
speed increases. Exceeding speed limits may cause loss of control.
● Before  starting  out,  check  the  trailer  lights,  tires  and  the  vehicle-

trailer connections. Recheck after driving a short distance.

● Practice turning, stopping and reversing with the trailer attached in
an area away from traffic until you become accustomed to the feel
of the vehicle-trailer combination.

● Reversing with a trailer attached is difficult and requires practice.
Grip the bottom of the steering wheel and move your hand to the
left to move the trailer to the left. Move your hand to the right to
move  the  trailer  to  right.  (This  is  generally  opposite  to  reversing
without a trailer attached.) Avoid sharp or prolonged turning. Have
someone guide you when reversing to reduce the risk of an acci-
dent.

● As stopping distance is increased when towing a trailer, vehicle-to
vehicle distance should be increased. For each 10 mph (16 km/h)
of speed, allow at least one vehicle and trailer length.

● Avoid sudden braking as you may skid, resulting in the trailer jack-
knifing and a loss of vehicle control. This is especially true on wet or
slippery surfaces.

4-1. Before driving

● Avoid jerky starts or sudden acceleration.
● Avoid jerky steering and sharp turns, and slow down before making

turns.

● Note that when making a turn, the trailer wheels will be closer than
the vehicle wheels to the inside of the turn. Compensate by making
a wider than normal turning radius.

● Slow down before making a turn, in cross winds, on wet or slippery

surfaces, etc.
Increasing vehicle speed can destabilize the trailer.

● Take care when passing other vehicles. Passing requires consider-
able distance. After passing a vehicle, do not forget the length of
your trailer, and be sure you have plenty of room before changing
lanes.

● To maintain engine braking efficiency and charging system perfor-
mance when using engine braking, do not put the transmission in
D.

● Instability happens more frequently when descending steep or long
downhill grades. Before descending, slow down and downshift. Do
not make sudden downshifts while descending steep or long down-
hill grades.

● Avoid holding the brake pedal down too long or applying the brakes
too frequently. This could cause the brakes to overheat and result in
reduced braking efficiency.

● Due to the added load of the trailer, your vehicle’s engine may over-
heat on hot days (at temperatures over 85 °F [30 °C]) when driving
up a long or steep grade. If the engine coolant temperature gauge
indicates overheating, immediately turn off the air conditioning (if in
use), pull your vehicle off the road and stop in a safe spot. 
(P. 484)

SEQUOIA_OM_USA_OM0C013U_19MY

4-1. Before driving

191

● Always place wheel blocks under both the vehicle’s and the trailer’s
wheels when parking. Apply the parking brake firmly, and put the
transmission in P. Avoid parking on a slope, but if unavoidable, do
so only after performing the following:

Apply the brakes and keep them applied.
Have someone place wheel blocks under both the vehicle’s and
trailer’s wheels.
When the wheel blocks are in place, release the brakes slowly
until the blocks absorb the load.
Apply the parking brake firmly.
Shift into P and turn off the engine.

● When restarting after parking on a slope:

With the transmission in P, start the engine. Be sure to keep the
brake pedal pressed.
Shift into a forward gear. If reversing, shift into R.
Release the parking brake and brake pedal, and slowly pull or
back away from the wheel blocks. Stop and apply the brakes.
Have someone retrieve the blocks.

■Matching trailer ball height to trailer coupler height

No  matter  which  class  of  tow  hitch
applies,  for  a  safer  trailer  hookup,  the
trailer  ball  setup  must  be  the  proper
height for the coupler on the trailer.

■Before towing

Check that the following conditions are met:
●Ensure that your vehicle’s tires are properly inflated. (P. 499)
●Trailer tires are inflated according to the trailer manufacturer’s recommen-

dation.

●All trailer lights work as required by law.
●All lights work each time you connect them.
●The trailer ball is set at the proper height for the coupler on the trailer.
●The trailer is level when it is hitched. 

Do not drive if the trailer is not level, and check for improper tongue weight,
overloading, worn suspension, or other possible causes.

●The trailer cargo is securely loaded.
●The rear view mirrors conform to all applicable federal, state/provincial or
local regulations. If they do not, install rear view mirrors appropriate for tow-
ing purposes.

●Depress “TOW/HAUL” button (if equipped)

■AVS (adaptive variable suspension system) (if equipped)

The suspension can be switched for improvement in drivability. (P. 294)

■Break-in schedule

If  your  vehicle  is  new  or  equipped  with  any  new  power  train  components
(such as an engine, transmission, differential or wheel bearing), Toyota rec-
ommends that you do not tow a trailer until the vehicle has been driven for
over 500 miles (800 km).
After the vehicle has been driven for over 500 miles (800 km), you can start
towing. However, for the next 500 miles (800 km), drive the vehicle at a speed
of less than 50 mph (80 km/h) when towing a trailer, and avoid full throttle
acceleration.
■Maintenance

●If you tow a trailer, your vehicle will require more frequent maintenance due
to  the  additional  load.  (See  “Scheduled  Maintenance  Guide”  or  “Owner’s
Manual Supplement”.)

●Retighten the fixing bolts of the towing ball and bracket after approximately

600 miles (1000 km) of trailer towing.

SEQUOIA_OM_USA_OM0C013U_19MY

4-1. Before driving

193

■If trailer sway occurs

One  or  more  factors  (crosswinds,  passing  vehicles,  rough  roads,  etc.)  can
adversely affect handling of your vehicle and trailer, causing instability.
●If trailer swaying occurs:

• Firmly grip the steering wheel. Steer straight ahead.

Do not try to control trailer swaying by turning the steering wheel.

• Begin releasing the accelerator pedal immediately but very gradually to

reduce speed.
Do not increase speed. Do not apply vehicle brakes.

If you make no extreme correction with the steering or brakes, your vehicle
and trailer should stabilize. (if enabled, Trailer Sway Control can also help to
stabilize the vehicle and trailer.)
●After the trailer swaying has stopped:

• Stop in a safe place. Get all occupants out of the vehicle.
• Check the tires of the vehicle and the trailer.
• Check the load in the trailer.

Make sure the load has not shifted.
Make sure the tongue weight is appropriate, if possible.

• Check the load in the vehicle.

Make sure the vehicle is not overloaded after occupants get in.

If you cannot find any problems, the speed at which trailer swaying occurred
is beyond the limit of your particular vehicle-trailer combination.
Drive at a lower speed to prevent instability. Remember that swaying of the
towing vehicle-trailer increases as speed increases.

WARNING

■Trailer towing precautions

●To tow a trailer safely, use extreme care and drive the vehicle in accor-
dance with the trailer’s characteristics and operating conditions. Failure to
do so could cause an accident resulting in death or serious injury. Vehicle
stability and braking performance are affected by trailer stability, brake set-
ting  and  performance,  and  the  hitch. Your  vehicle  will  handle  differently
when towing a trailer.

●Vehicles  with  electronically  modulated  air  suspension:  Set  the  vehicle
height to the “N” mode and turn off the rear height control air suspension
when you connect a trailer, otherwise the vehicle height may change due
to the automatic leveling function, and you may catch part of your body in
the vehicle, resulting in an accident.

■To avoid accident or injury

●Do not exceed the TWR, unbraked TWR, GCWR, GVWR or GAWR.
●If the gross trailer weight is over 2000 lb. (907 kg), a sway control device

with sufficient capacity is required.

●If the gross trailer weight is over 5000 lb. (2268 kg), a weight distributing

hitch with sufficient capacity is required.

●Adjust the tongue weight within the appropriate range. Place heavier loads

as close to the trailer axle as possible.

●Do not exceed 65 mph (104 km/h), the posted towing speed limit or the
speed  limit  for  your  trailer  as  set  forth  in  your  trailer  owner’s  manual,
whichever is lowest. Slow down sufficiently before making a turn, in cross
winds, on wet or slippery surface, etc. to help avoid an accident. If you
experience a vehicle-trailer instability from reducing a certain speed, slow
down  and  make  sure  you  keep  your  vehicle  speed  under  the  speed  of
which you experience the instability.

●Do not make jerky, abrupt or sharp turns.

SEQUOIA_OM_USA_OM0C013U_19MY

4-1. Before driving

195

WARNING

●Do not apply the brakes suddenly as you may skid, resulting in jackknifing
and loss of vehicle control. This is especially true on wet or slippery sur-
faces.

●Do  not  exceed  the  trailer  hitch  assembly  weight,  gross  vehicle  weight,

gross axle weight and trailer tongue weight capacities.

●Do not use cruise control when towing.
●Slow  down  and  downshift  before  descending  steep  or  long  downhill
grades. Do not make sudden downshifts while descending steep or long
downhill grades.

●Vehicle-trailer  instability  is  more  likely  on  steep  long  downhills.  Before
descending steep or long downhill grades, slow down and downshift. Do
not  make  sudden  downshifts  when  descending  steep  or  long  downhill
grades.  Avoid  holding  the  brake  pedal  down  too  long  or  applying  the
brakes too frequently. This could cause the brakes to overheat and result
in reduced braking efficiency.

●Do not tow a trailer when the temporary spare tire is installed on your vehi-

Trailer hitch assemblies have different weight capacities established by the
hitch manufacturer. Even though the vehicle may be physically capable of
towing a higher weight, the operator must determine the maximum weight
rating  of  the  particular  hitch  assembly  and  never  exceed  the  maximum
weight rating specified for the trailer-hitch. Exceeding the maximum weight
rating set by the trailer-hitch manufacturer can cause an accident resulting
in death or serious personal injuries.

WARNING

■When towing a trailer

Toyota recommends trailers with brakes that conform to any applicable fed-
eral and state/provincial regulations.
●If  the  gross  trailer  weight  exceeds  unbraked  TWR,  trailer  brakes  are
required. Toyota recommends trailers with brakes that conform to all appli-
cable federal and state/provincial regulations.

●Never tap into your vehicle’s hydraulic system, as this will lower the vehi-

cle’s braking effectiveness.

●Never tow a trailer without using a safety chain securely attached to both
the trailer and the vehicle. If damage occurs to the coupling unit or hitch
ball, there is danger of the trailer wandering into another lane.

NOTICE

■When installing a trailer hitch

Use only the position recommended by your Toyota dealer. Do not install
the trailer hitch on the bumper; this may cause body damage.

■Do not directly splice trailer lights

Do not directly splice trailer lights. Directly splicing trailer lights may damage

possible even when the shift lever is operated. (A buzzer will sound twice.) 

■Transmission protection function

If the tires spin continually when the vehicle becomes stuck in mud, dirt or
snow,  the  automatic  transmission  temperature  may  become  too  high  and
cause damage.
To avoid the damaging the automatic transmission, the system may tempo-
rarily lock the gear in 1st.
If the automatic transmission temperature falls, the gear locking is canceled
and returns the automatic transmission to the normal operation.

WARNING

■When driving on slippery road surfaces

Be careful of downshifting and sudden acceleration, as this could result in
the vehicle skidding to the side or spinning.

■To prevent an accident when releasing the shift lock

Before pressing the shift lock override button, make sure to set the parking
brake and depress the brake pedal.
If the accelerator pedal is accidentally depressed instead of the brake pedal
when the shift lock override button is pressed and the shift lever is shifted

WARNING

■When refueling the vehicle

Observe the following precautions while refueling the vehicle. Failure to do
so may result in death or serious injury.
●After  exiting  the  vehicle  and  before  opening  the  fuel  door,  touch  an
unpainted metal surface to discharge any static electricity. It is important to
discharge static electricity before refueling because sparks resulting from
static electricity can cause fuel vapors to ignite while refueling.

●Always hold the grips on the fuel tank cap and turn it slowly to remove it. 
A  whooshing  sound  may  be  heard  when  the  fuel  tank  cap  is  loosened.
Wait until the sound cannot be heard before fully removing the cap. In hot
weather, pressurized fuel may spray out the filler neck and cause injury.

●Do not allow anyone that has not discharged static electricity  from their

body to come close to an open fuel tank.

●Do not inhale vaporized fuel.

Fuel contains substances that are harmful if inhaled.

●Do not smoke while refueling the vehicle.

Doing so may cause the fuel to ignite and cause a fire.

●Do not return to the vehicle or touch any person or object that is statically

charged.
This may cause static electricity to build up, resulting in a possible ignition
hazard.

■When refueling

Observe the following precautions to prevent fuel overflowing from the fuel
tank:
●Securely insert the fuel nozzle into the fuel filler neck.
●Stop filling the tank after the fuel nozzle automatically clicks off.
●Do not top off the fuel tank.

NOTICE

■Refueling

Do not spill fuel during refueling. 
Doing so may damage the vehicle, such as causing the emission control
system to operate abnormally, damage fuel system,  or damage the vehi-

PCS (Pre-Collision System)

The pre-collision system uses a radar sensor and camera sen-
sor to detect vehicles and pedestrians in front of your vehicle.
When the system determines that the possibility of a frontal col-
lision with a vehicle or pedestrian is high, a warning operates to
urge  the  driver  to  take  evasive  action  and  the  potential  brake
pressure is increased to help the driver avoid the collision. If the
system determines that the possibility of a frontal collision with
a vehicle or pedestrian is extremely high, the brakes are auto-
matically applied to help avoid the collision or help reduce the
impact of the collision.
The pre-collision system can be disabled/enabled and the warning
timing can be changed. (P. 238)

◆ Pre-collision warning

When  the  system  determines
that  the  possibility  of  a  frontal
collision  is  high,  a  buzzer  will
sound and a warning message
will  be  displayed  on  the  multi-
information  display  to  urge  the
driver to take evasive action.

◆ Pre-collision brake assist

When the system determines that the possibility of a frontal colli-
sion is high, the system applies greater braking force in relation to
how strongly the brake pedal is depressed.

◆ Pre-collision braking

When the system determines that the possibility of a frontal colli-
sion is high, the system warns the driver. If the system determines
that the possibility of a frontal collision is extremely high, the brakes
are automatically applied to help avoid the collision or reduce the

WARNING

■Limitations of the pre-collision system

●The driver is solely responsible for safe driving. Always drive safely, taking

care to observe your surroundings. 
Do not use the pre-collision system instead of normal braking operations
under any circumstances. This system will not prevent collisions or lessen
collision damage or injury in every situation. Do not overly rely on this sys-
tem. Failure to do so may lead to an accident, resulting in death or serious
injury.

●Although this system is designed to help avoid a collision or help reduce
the impact of the collision, its effectiveness may change according to vari-
ous conditions, therefore the system may not always be able to achieve
the same level of performance. 
Read the following conditions carefully. Do not overly rely on this system
and always drive carefully.
• Conditions under which the system may operate even if there is no pos-

sibility of a collision: P. 242

• Conditions under which the system may not operate properly: P. 244
●Do not attempt to test the operation of the pre-collision system yourself, as

the system may not operate properly, possibly leading to an accident.

●When  the  pre-collision  braking  function  is  operating,  a  large  amount  of

braking force will be applied.

●If the vehicle is stopped by the operation of the pre-collision braking func-
tion,  the  pre-collision  braking  function  operation  will  be  canceled  after
approximately 2 seconds. Depress the brake pedal as necessary.

●The pre-collision braking function may not operate if certain operations are
performed  by  the  driver.  If  the  accelerator  pedal  is  being  depressed
strongly or the steering wheel is being turned, the system may determine
that the driver is taking evasive action and possibly prevent the pre-colli-
sion braking function from operating.

●In  some  situations,  while  the  pre-collision  braking  function  is  operating,
operation  of  the  function  may  be  canceled  if  the  accelerator  pedal  is
depressed strongly or the steering wheel is turned and the system deter-
mines that the driver is taking evasive action.

●If the brake pedal is being depressed, the system may determine that the
driver is taking evasive action and possibly delay the operation timing of
the pre-collision braking function.

■Operational conditions

The pre-collision system is enabled and the system determines that the pos-
sibility of a frontal collision with a vehicle or pedestrian is high.
Each function is operational at the following speeds:
●Pre-collision warning:

• Vehicle speed is between approximately 7 and 110 mph (10 and 180 km/h).
(For detecting a pedestrian, vehicle speed is between approximately 7 and
50 mph [10 and 80 km/h].)

• The relative speed between your vehicle and the vehicle or pedestrian

ahead is approximately 7 mph (10 km/h) or more.

●Pre-collision brake assist: 

• Vehicle speed is between approximately 20 and 110 mph (30 and 180 km/h).
(For detecting a pedestrian, vehicle speed is between approximately 20 and
50 mph [30 and 80 km/h].)

• The relative speed between your vehicle and the vehicle or pedestrian

ahead is approximately 20 mph (30 km/h) or more.

●Pre-collision braking:

• Vehicle speed is between approximately 7 and 110 mph (10 and 180 km/h).
(For detecting a pedestrian, vehicle speed is between approximately 7 and
50 mph [10 and 80 km/h].)

• The relative speed between your vehicle and the vehicle or pedestrian

ahead is approximately 7 mph (10 km/h) or more.

The system may not operate in the following situations:
●If a battery terminal has been disconnected and reconnected and then the

vehicle has not been driven for a certain amount of time

●If the shift lever is in R
●If  VSC  is  disabled  (only  the  pre-collision  warning  function  will  be  opera-

tional)

●If the low speed four-wheel drive indicator is illuminated (only the pre-colli-

sion warning function will be operational)

■Pedestrian detection function

The pre-collision system detects pedestri-
ans based on the size, profile, and motion
of  a  detected  object.  However,  a  pedes-
trian  may  not  be  detected  depending  on
the
the  surrounding  brightness  and 
motion,  posture,  and  angle  of 
the
detected  object,  preventing  the  system
from operating properly. (P. 246)

■Cancelation of the pre-collision braking

If either of the following occur while the pre-collision braking function is oper-
ating, it will be canceled:
●The accelerator pedal is depressed strongly.

WARNING

■Before using LDA system

Do not rely solely upon the LDA system. The LDA system does not auto-
matically drive the vehicle or reduce the amount of attention that must be
paid to the area in front of the vehicle. The driver must always assume full
responsibility for driving safely by always paying careful attention to the sur-
rounding conditions and operating the steering wheel to correct the path of
the vehicle. Also, the driver must take adequate breaks when fatigued, such
as from driving for a long period of time.
Failure to perform appropriate driving operations and pay careful attention
may lead to an accident, resulting in death or serious injury.

■To avoid operating LDA system by mistake

When not using the LDA system, use the LDA switch to turn the system off.

■Situations unsuitable for LDA system

Do not use the LDA system in the following situations.
The system may not operate properly and lead to an accident, resulting in
death or serious injury.

WARNING

■Before using dynamic radar cruise control

Driving safely is the sole responsibility of the driver. Do not rely solely on the
system,  and  drive  safely  by  always  paying  careful  attention  to  your  sur-
roundings.
The dynamic radar cruise control provides driving assistance to reduce the
driver’s burden. However, there are limitations to the assistance provided.
Set the speed appropriately depending on the speed limit, traffic flow, road
conditions, weather conditions, etc. The driver is responsible for checking
the set speed.
Even when the system is functioning normally, the condition of the preced-
ing  vehicle  as  detected  by  the  system  may  differ  from  the  condition
observed  by  the  driver.  Therefore,  the  driver  must  always  remain  alert,
assess the danger of each situation and drive safely. Relying on this system
or assuming the system ensures safety while driving can lead to an acci-
dent, resulting in death or serious injury.

■Cautions regarding the driving assist systems

Observe the following precautions, as there are limitations to the assistance
provided by the system.
Failure to do so may cause an accident resulting in death or serious injury.
●Assisting the driver to measure following distance

The  dynamic  radar  cruise  control  is  only  intended  to  help  the  driver  in
determining the following distance between the driver’s own vehicle and a
designated vehicle traveling ahead. It is not a mechanism that allows care-
less or inattentive driving, and it is not a system that can assist the driver in
low-visibility conditions. It is still necessary for driver to pay close attention
to the vehicle’s surroundings.

●Assisting the driver to judge proper following distance

The  dynamic  radar  cruise  control  determines  whether  the  following  dis-
tance between the driver’s own vehicle and a designated vehicle traveling
ahead is within a set range. It is not capable of making any other type of
judgement. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary for the driver to remain
vigilant and to determine whether or not there is a possibility of danger in
any given situation.

●Assisting the driver to operate the vehicle 

The dynamic radar cruise control has limited capability to prevent or avoid
a collision with a vehicle traveling ahead. Therefore, if there is ever any
danger, the driver must take immediate and direct control of the vehicle
and act appropriately in order to ensure the safety of all involved.

Driving in vehicle-to-vehicle distance control mode
This mode employs a radar sensor to detect the presence of vehicles
up  to  approximately  328  ft.  (100  m)  ahead,  determines  the  current
vehicle-to-vehicle following distance, and operates to maintain a suit-
able following distance from the vehicle ahead.

Note that vehicle-to-vehicle distance will close in when traveling on long
downhill slopes.

Example of constant speed cruising
When there are no vehicles ahead
The vehicle travels at the speed set by the driver. The desired vehicle-to-
vehicle  distance  can  also  be  set  by  operating  the  vehicle-to-vehicle  dis-
tance switch.
Example of deceleration cruising and follow-up cruising
When  a  preceding  vehicle  driving  slower  than  the  set  speed
appears
When a vehicle is detected running ahead of you, the system automatically
decelerates  your  vehicle.  When  a  greater  reduction  in  vehicle  speed  is
necessary, the system applies the brakes (the stop lights will come on at
this time). The system will respond to changes in the speed of the vehicle
ahead in order to maintain the vehicle-to-vehicle distance set by the driver.
Approach  warning  warns  you  when  the  system  cannot  decelerate  suffi-
ciently to prevent your vehicle from closing in on the vehicle ahead.
Example of acceleration 
When  there  are  no  longer  any  preceding  vehicles  driving  slower
than the set speed
The system accelerates until the set speed is reached. The system then
returns to constant speed cruising.

■Limitations of the sensors

●The detection areas of the sensors are limited to the areas around the vehi-

cle’s front corners and the rear bumpers.

●Certain vehicle conditions and surrounding environments, such as the fol-
lowing, may affect the ability of the sensors to correctly detect objects. Pay
particular attention in the following situations. Failure to do so may result in
the vehicle being driven unsafely, possibly leading to an accident.
• When  there  is  dirt,  snow  or  ice  on  a  sensor  (Cleaning  the  sensor  will

resolve this problem.)

• When the sensor is frozen (Thawing the area will resolve this problem.)
In especially cold weather, if a sensor is frozen the screen may show an
abnormal display, or objects may not be detected
• When a sensor is covered in any way
• When the vehicle is leaning considerably to one side
• When driving on an extremely bumpy road, incline, gravel, or grass
• When the vicinity of the vehicle is noisy due to vehicle horns, motorcycle
engines, air brakes of large vehicles, or other loud noises producing ultra-
sonic waves

• When there is another vehicle equipped with parking assist sensor in the

vicinity

• When the sensor is coated with a sheet of spray or heavy rain
• When the vehicle is equipped with a fender pole or wireless antenna
• When a towing eyelet is installed
• When a bumper or sensor receives a strong impact
• A backlit license plate, license plate holder, etc., are installed.
• When the vehicle is approaching a tall or curved curb
• When driving in harsh sunlight or intense cold weather
• When an object is directly under a bumper
• When objects become too close to the sensors
• When  a  non-genuine  Toyota  suspension  (lowered  suspension,  etc.)  is

In addition to the situations above, there are instances in which, because of
their shape, signs and other objects  may  be judged by the sensor to be
closer than they are.

ular attention to the following:
• Wires, fences, ropes, etc.
• Cotton, snow and other materials that absorb sound waves
• Sharply-angled objects
• Low objects
• Tall  objects  with  upper  sections  projecting  outwards  in  the  direction  of

your vehicle

• People, animals and other moving objects
• People wearing certain types of clothing

●The following situations may occur when using the intuitive parking assist.
• Depending on the shape of the object and other factors, the detection dis-

tance may be shortened, or detection may not be possible.

• Objects may not be detected if they are too close to a sensor.
• There will be a short delay between the detection of an object and display
of the detection. Even at slow speeds, there is a possibility that the object
will  come  within  a  sensor’s  detection  area  before  the  display  is  shown
and a warning beep sounds.

• Thin  posts  or  objects  lower  than  a  sensor  may  not  be  detected  when

approached, even if they have been detected once.

• It might be difficult to hear beeps due to the volume of the audio system

or air flow noise of the air conditioning system.

WARNING

■Cautions regarding the use of the system

The driver is solely responsible for safe driving. Always drive safely, taking
care to observe your surroundings.
The Blind Spot Monitor function is a supplementary function which alerts the
driver that a vehicle is present in the blind spot. Do not overly rely on the
Blind Spot Monitor function. The function cannot judge if it is safe to change
lanes, therefore over reliance could cause an accident resulting in death or
serious injury.
According to conditions, the system may not function correctly. Therefore
the driver’s own visual confirmation of safety is necessary.

■The BSM function is operational when
●The BSM system is set to on (P. 278)

■The BSM function will detect a vehicle when

●A vehicle in an adjacent lane overtakes your vehicle.
●Another vehicle enters the detection area when it changes lanes.
●You overtake a vehicle in adjacent lane.

■Conditions under which the BSM function will not detect a vehicle

The BSM function is not designed to detect the following types of vehicles
and/or objects:
●Small motorcycles, bicycles, pedestrians, etc.*

WARNING

■The electronically modulated air suspension must be turned off in the

following circumstances:
Otherwise, the automatic leveling function may cause the vehicle’s height to
change, and you may catch part of your body in the vehicle, resulting in an
unexpected accident:
●When  driving  through  water  such  as  shallow  streams  (Put  the  vehicle
height in “HI” mode and turn off the electronically modulated air suspen-
sion. Drive at 18 mph [30 km/h] or slower.)

●When jacking up the vehicle, installing tire chains or tying the vehicle with
chains/wires for transportation via flat bed truck (Turn the system to the
manual mode and stop the engine.)

●When the vehicle must be towed (Put the vehicle height in “N” mode and

turn the system to the manual mode.)

●When the vehicle gets stuck (Turn the system to the manual mode.)
●When disconnecting a trailer (Put the vehicle height in “N” mode and turn

the system to the manual mode.)
■Selecting the correct height mode

Observe the following precautions to prevent accidents.
Failure to do so may cause damage to parts of the vehicle, as well as dan-
gerous handling characteristics, which may lead to fatal or injury accidents.
●Before  you  lower  the  vehicle’s  height,  check  under  the  vehicle  to  make

sure that no one is there.

●“HI” mode should only be used when driving on rough roads, for example

when driving off-road.
Because  the  vehicle’s  center  of  gravity  will  become  higher  when  in  the
mode, the vehicle may become unstable when turning abruptly, resulting
in an accident.

●Do not select “HI” mode when you load cargo on the roof luggage carrier.
Because  the  vehicle’s  center  of  gravity  will  become  higher  when  in  the
mode, the vehicle may become unstable when turning abruptly, resulting
in an accident.

NOTICE

■Be careful in any place where overhead space is limited.

When changing to a higher mode or after unloading, the vehicle height will
rise. This may cause damage to the vehicle.

■Do not select “LO” mode when driving on bumpy roads.

If the underbody of the vehicle touches a rugged road surface, the vehicle
may be damaged.

■Do not change the vehicle height frequently.

The compressor might overheat and cause the operation to stop.

■When on the extremely uneven roads with rocks

Sometimes  the  vehicle  height  is  not  adjusted  because  it  is  judged  as
uneven road driving.

■If the “4LO” indicator, “4HI” indicator or the center differential lock indi-

cator blinks
●If the “4LO” indicator continues to blink when shifting between “4H” and “4L”,
stop the vehicle completely, move the shift lever to N and operate the switch
again.

●If the shift lever is moved before the “4LO” indicator turns on/off, the transfer
mode may not be shifted completely. The transfer mode disengages both
the front and rear driveshafts from the powertrain and allows the vehicle to
move regardless of the shift position. (At this time, the indicator blinks and
the buzzer sounds.)
Therefore, the vehicle is free to roll even if the automatic transmission is in
P. You or someone else could be seriously injured. You must complete the
shifting of the transfer mode.
To complete the shifting, stop the vehicle completely, return the shift lever to
N, and confirm that the shift was completed (The indicator turns on/off).

●If the engine coolant temperature is too low, transfer mode may not be able

to shift. When the engine is warmer, turn the switch again.

If the “4LO” indicator, “4HI” indicator or the center differential lock indicator
continues to blink even after attempting the above, there may be a malfunc-
tion in the engine, the brake system or the four-wheel drive system. In this
case, you may not be able to shift between “2WD” and “4H”, “4H” and “4L”,
and  the  center  differential  lock  may  not  be  operable.  Have  the  vehicle
inspected by your Toyota dealer immediately.

Driving assist systems

To keep driving safety and performance, the following systems
operate automatically in response to various driving situations.
Be aware, however, that these systems are supplementary and
should not be relied upon too heavily when operating the vehi-
cle. 

◆ ABS (Anti-lock Brake System)

Helps to prevent wheel lock when the brakes are applied suddenly,
or if the brakes are applied while driving on a slippery road surface

◆ Brake assist

Generates an increased level of braking force after the brake pedal
is depressed when the system detects a panic stop situation

◆ VSC (Vehicle Stability Control)

Helps  the  driver  to  control  skidding  when  swerving  suddenly  or
turning on slippery road surfaces

◆ Trailer Sway Control

Helps the driver to control trailer sway by selectively applying brake
pressure  for  individual  wheels  and  reducing  driving  torque  when
trailer sway is detected.

◆ TRAC (Traction Control)

Helps to maintain drive power and prevent the drive wheels from
spinning when starting the vehicle or accelerating on slippery roads

◆ Hill-start assist control

Helps to reduce the backward movement of the vehicle when start-

●The  limits  of  tire  gripping  performance  have  been  exceeded  (such  as

excessively worn tires on a snow covered road).

●The vehicle hydroplanes while driving at high speed on wet or slick road.
■Stopping distance when the ABS is operating may exceed that of nor-

mal conditions
The ABS is not designed to shorten the vehicle’s stopping distance. Always
maintain a safe distance from the vehicle in front of you, especially in the
following situations:
●When driving on dirt, gravel or snow-covered roads
●When driving with tire chains
●When driving over bumps in the road
●When driving over roads with potholes or uneven roads
■When the TRAC/VSC/Trailer Sway Control is activated

The slip indicator light flashes. Always drive carefully. Reckless driving may
cause an accident. Exercise particular care when the indicator light flashes.

■TRAC/VSC may not operate effectively when

Directional control and power may not be achievable while driving on slip-
pery road surfaces, even if the TRAC/VSC system is operating.
Drive the vehicle carefully in conditions where stability and power may be
lost.

■Hill-start assist control does not operate effectively when

●Do not overly rely on hill-start assist control. Hill-start assist control may

not operate effectively on steep inclines and roads covered with ice.

●Unlike the parking brake, hill-start assist control is not intended to hold the
vehicle stationary for an extended period of time. Do not attempt to use
hill-start assist control to hold the vehicle on an incline, as doing so may
lead to an accident.

WARNING

■When the TRAC/VSC/Trailer Sway Control systems is turned off

Be especially careful and drive at a speed appropriate to the road condi-
tions. As these are the systems to help ensure vehicle stability and driving
force, do not turn the TRAC/VSC/Trailer Sway Control systems off unless
necessary.

■Replacing tires

Make sure that all tires are of the specified size, brand, tread pattern and
total load capacity. In addition, make sure that the tires are inflated to the
recommended tire inflation pressure level.
The ABS, TRAC, Trailer Sway Control and VSC systems will not function
correctly if different tires are installed on the vehicle.
Contact your Toyota dealer for further information when replacing tires or
wheels.

■Handling of tires and the suspension

Using tires with any kind of problem or modifying the suspension will affect
the driving assist systems, and may cause a system to malfunction.

■Trailer Sway Control precaution

The Trailer Sway Control system is not able to reduce trailer sway in all situ-
ations. Depending on many factors such as the conditions of the vehicle,
trailer, road surface, and driving environment, the Trailer Sway Control sys-
tem may not be effective. Refer to your trailer owner’s manual for informa-
tion on how to tow your trailer properly.

■If trailer sway occurs

Observe the following precautions. 
Failing to do so may cause death or serious injury.
●Firmly grip the steering wheel. Steer straight ahead.

Do not try to control trailer swaying by turning the steering wheel.

●Begin  releasing  the  accelerator  pedal  immediately  but  very  gradually  to

reduce speed. 
Do not increase speed. Do not apply vehicle brakes.

If you make no extreme correction with the steering or brakes, your vehicle
and trailer should stabilize. (P. 193)

Off-road precautions

This  vehicle  belongs  to  the  utility  vehicle  class,  which  has
higher  ground  clearance  and  narrower  tread  in  relation  to  the
height of its center of gravity to make it capable of performing in
a wide variety of off-road applications.

Off-road vehicle feature
● Specific design characteristics give it a higher center of gravity than
ordinary  passenger  cars. This  vehicle  design  feature  causes  this
type  of  vehicle  to  be  more  likely  to  rollover. And,  utility  vehicles
have a significantly higher rollover rate than other types of vehicles.
● An advantage of the higher ground clearance is a better view of the

road allowing you to anticipate problems.

● It is not designed for cornering at the same speeds as ordinary pas-
senger cars any more than low-slung sports cars designed to per-
form satisfactorily under off-road conditions. Therefore, sharp turns
at excessive speeds may cause rollover.

WARNING

■Off-road vehicle precautions

Always observe the following precautions to minimize the risk of death, seri-
ous injury or damage to your vehicle:
●In a rollover crash, an unbelted person is significantly more likely to die
than a person wearing a seat belt. Therefore, the driver and all passengers
should always fasten their seat belts.

●Avoid sharp turns or abrupt maneuvers, if at all possible. 

Failure  to  operate  this  vehicle  correctly  may  result  in  loss  of  control  or
vehicle rollover causing death or serious injury.

●Loading cargo on the roof luggage carrier will make the center of the vehi-
cle gravity higher. Avoid high speeds, sudden starts, sharp turns, sudden
braking or abrupt maneuvers, otherwise it may result in loss of control or
vehicle rollover due to failure to operate this vehicle correctly.

●Always slow down in gusty crosswinds. Because of its profile and higher
center of gravity, your vehicle is more sensitive to side winds than an ordi-
nary passenger car. Slowing down will allow you to have better control.

●When  driving  off-road  or  in  rugged  terrain,  do  not  drive  at  excessive
speeds, jump, make sharp turns, strike objects, etc. This may cause loss
of control or vehicle rollover causing death or serious injury. You are also
risking expensive damage to your vehicle’s suspension and chassis.

●Do  not  drive  horizontally  across  steep  slopes.  Driving  straight  up  or
straight  down  is  preferred. Your  vehicle  (or  any  similar  off-road  vehicle)
can tip over sideways much more easily than forward or backward.

■Off-road driving precautions

Always observe the following precautions to minimize the risk of death, seri-
ous injury or damage to your vehicle:
●Drive carefully when off the road. Do not take unnecessary risks by driving

in dangerous places.

●Do not grip the steering wheel spokes when driving off-road. A bad bump
could jerk the wheel and injure your hands. Keep both hands and espe-
cially your thumbs on the outside of the rim.

●Always  check  your  brakes  for  effectiveness  immediately  after  driving  in

sand, mud, water or snow.

●After  driving through tall  grass,  mud, rock, sand,  rivers,  etc., check  that
there is no grass, bush, paper, rags, stone, sand, etc. adhering or trapped
on  the  underbody.  Clear  off  any  such  matter  from  the  underbody.  If  the
vehicle is used with these materials trapped or adhering to the underbody,
a breakdown or fire could occur.

●In a rollover crash, an unbelted person is significantly more likely to die
than a person wearing a seat belt. Therefore, the driver and all passengers
should fasten their seat belts whenever the vehicle is moving.

●When  driving  off-road  or  in  rugged  terrain,  do  not  drive  at  excessive
speeds, jump, make sharp turns, strike objects, etc. This may cause loss
of control or vehicle rollover causing death or serious injury. You are also

NOTICE

■To prevent water damage

●Take all necessary safety measures to ensure that water damage to the

engine or other components does not occur.

●Water entering the engine air intake will cause severe engine damage.
●Water entering the automatic transmission will cause deterioration in shift
quality, locking up of your transmission accompanied by vibration, and ulti-
mately damage.

●Water can wash the grease from wheel bearings, causing rusting and pre-
mature  failure,  and  may  also  enter  the  differentials,  transmission  and
transfer case, reducing the gear oil’s lubricating qualities.

■When you drive through water

If driving through water, such as when crossing shallow streams, first check
the depth of the water and the bottom of the riverbed for firmness. Drive
slowly and avoid deep water.

■Inspection after off-road driving

●Sand and mud that has accumulated in brake drums and around brake
discs may affect braking efficiency and may damage brake system compo-
nents.

●Always perform a maintenance inspection after each day of off-road driv-
ing  that  has  taken  you  through  rough  terrain,  sand,  mud,  or  water.  For
scheduled maintenance information, refer to the “Scheduled Maintenance
Guide” or “Owner’s Manual Supplement”.

Before driving the vehicle
Perform the following according to the driving conditions:
● Do not try to forcibly open a window or move a wiper that is frozen.
Pour warm water over the frozen area to melt the ice. Wipe away
the water immediately to prevent it from freezing.

● To  ensure  proper  operation  of  the  climate  control  system  fan,
remove  any  snow  that  has  accumulated  on  the  air  inlet  vents  in
front of the windshield.

● Check for and remove any excess ice or snow that may have accu-
mulated on  the  exterior  lights,  vehicle’s  roof,  chassis, around  the
tires or on the brakes.

● Remove any snow or mud from the bottom of your shoes before

getting in the vehicle.

When driving the vehicle
Accelerate the vehicle slowly, keep a safe distance between you and
the vehicle ahead, and drive at a reduced speed suitable to road con-
ditions.
When parking the vehicle
● Park the vehicle and move the shift lever to P without setting the
parking brake. The parking brake may freeze up, preventing it from
being released. If the vehicle is parked without setting the parking
brake, make sure to block the wheels.
Failure to do so may be dangerous because it may cause the vehi-
cle to move unexpectedly, possibly leading to an accident.

● If the vehicle is parked without setting the parking brake, confirm

that the shift lever cannot be moved out of P*.

*: The shift lever will be locked if it is attempted to be shifted from P to any
other position without depressing the brake pedal. If the shift lever can be
shifted from P, there may be a problem with the shift lock system. Have the
vehicle inspected by your Toyota dealer immediately.

■When to replace your vehicle’s tires

Tires should be replaced if:
●The treadwear indicators are showing on a tire.
●You  have  tire  damage  such  as  cuts,  splits,  cracks  deep  enough  to

expose the fabric, and bulges indicating internal damage

●A tire goes flat repeatedly or cannot be properly repaired due to the size

or location of a cut or other damage

If you are not sure, consult with your Toyota dealer.

■When replacing the tires and wheels

If the ID code of the tire pressure warning valve and transmitter is not reg-
istered, the tire pressure warning system will not work properly. After driv-
ing  for  about  20  minutes,  the  tire  pressure  warning  light  blinks  for  1
minute and stays on to indicate a system malfunction.

■Tire life

Any tire over 6 years old must be checked by a qualified technician even
if it has seldom or never been used, or damage is not obvious.

■Routine tire inflation pressure checks

The tire pressure warning system does not replace routine tire inflation
pressure  checks.  Make  sure  to  check  tire  inflation  pressure  as  part  of
your routine of daily vehicle checks.

■Maximum load of tire

Check that the number given by dividing the maximum load by 1.10 of the
replacement  tire  is  greater  than  1/2  of  the  Gross Axle  Weight  Ratings
(GAWR) of either the front axle or the rear axle, whichever is greater.
For  the  GAWR,  see  the  Certification
Label. For the maximum load of the tire,
see the load limit at maximum cold tire
inflation  pressure  mentioned  on  the
sidewall of the tire. (P. 504)

■Tire types

●Summer tires

Summer tires are high-speed performance tires best suited to highway
driving under dry conditions. Since summer tires do not have the same
traction  performance  as  snow  tires,  summer  tires  are  inadequate  for
driving  on  snow-covered  or  icy  roads.  For  driving  on  snow-covered
roads or icy roads, the use of snow tires is recommended. When install-
ing snow tires, be sure to replace all four tires.

●All season tires

All season tires are designed to provide better traction in snow and to
be  adequate  for  driving  in  most  winter  conditions  as  well  as  for  use
year-round. All  season  tires,  however,  do  not  have  adequate  traction
performance compared with snow tires in heavy or loose snow. Also, all
season tires fall short in acceleration and handling performance com-
pared with summer tires in highway driving.

●Snow tires

For driving on snow-covered roads or icy roads, we recommend using
snow tires. If you need snow tires, select tires of the same size, con-
struction and load capacity as the originally installed tires. Since your
vehicle  has  radial  tires  as  original  equipment,  make  sure  your  snow
tires also have radial construction. Do not install studded tires without
first  checking  local  regulations  for  possible  restrictions.  Snow  tires
should be installed on all wheels. (P. 314)

SEQUOIA_OM_USA_OM0C013U_19MY

6-3. Do-it-yourself maintenance

411

■Initializing the tire pressure warning system

Initialize the system with the tire inflation pressure adjusted to the speci-
fied level.

■If the tread on snow tires wears down below 0.16 in. (4 mm)

The effectiveness of the tires as snow tires is lost.

■Situations in which the tire pressure warning system may not oper-

ate properly
●In the following cases, the tire pressure warning system may not operate

properly.
• If non-genuine Toyota wheels are used. 
• A tire has been replaced with a tire that is not an OE (Original Equip-

ment) tire.

• A tire has been replaced with a tire that is not of the specified size.
• Tire chains, etc., are equipped.
• An auxiliary-supported run-flat tire is equipped.
• If a window tint that affects the radio wave signals is installed.
• If there is a lot of snow or ice on the vehicle, particularly around the

wheels or wheel housings.

• If  the  tire  inflation  pressure  is  extremely  higher  than  the  specified

• If  wheel  without  the  tire  pressure  warning  valve  and  transmitter  is

level.

used.

• If the ID code on the tire pressure warning valves and transmitters is

not registered in the tire pressure warning computer.

●Performance may be affected in the following situations.

• Near a TV tower, electric power plant, gas station, radio station, large
display, airport or other facility that generates strong radio waves or
electrical noise

• When  carrying  a  portable  radio,  cellular  phone,  cordless  phone  or

other wireless communication device

If  tire  position  information  is  not  correctly  displayed  due  to  the  radio
wave conditions, the display may be corrected by driving and changing
the radio wave conditions. 

●When the vehicle is parked, the time taken for the warning to start or go

off could be extended.

●When tire inflation pressure declines rapidly for example when a tire has

burst, the warning may not function.

■The initialization operation

●Make sure to carry out initialization after adjusting the tire inflation pres-

sure. 
Also, make sure the tires are cold before carrying out initialization or tire
inflation pressure adjustment.

●If you have accidentally turned the engine switch to the “LOCK” position
during initialization, it is not necessary to press the reset switch again as
initialization will restart automatically when the engine switch has been
turned to the “ON” position for the next time.

●If you accidentally press the reset switch when initialization is not neces-
sary,  adjust  the  tire  inflation  pressure  to  the  specified  level  when  the
tires are cold, and conduct initialization again.

●While the position of each tire is being determined and the inflation pres-
sures  are  not  being  displayed  on  the  multi-information  display,  if  the
inflation pressure of a tire drops, the tire pressure warning light will come
on.

■Warning performance of the tire pressure warning system

The  warning  of  the  tire  pressure  warning  system  will  change  in  accor-
dance with the conditions under which it was initialized. For this reason,
the system may give a warning even if the tire pressure does not reach a
low enough level, or if the pressure is higher than the pressure that was
adjusted to when the system was initialized.

■When initialization of the tire pressure warning system has failed

Initialization  may  take  longer  to  complete  if  the  vehicle  is  driven  on  an
unpaved  road.  When  performing  initialization,  drive  on  a  paved  road  if
possible. Depending on the driving environment and condition of the tires,
initialization will be completed in approximately 10 to 30 minutes. If initial-
ization is not complete after driving approximately 10 to 30 minutes, con-
tinue driving for a while.
If  the  inflation  pressure  of  each  tire  is  not  displayed  after  driving  for
approximately 1 hour, perform the following procedure.
●Park  the  vehicle  in  a  safe  place  for  approximately  20  minutes.  Then
drive  straight  (with  occasional  left  and  right  turns)  at  approximately
25 mph (40 km/h) or more for approximately 10 to 30 minutes.

However, in the following situations, the tire inflation pressure will not be
recorded and the system will not operate properly. Perform initialization
again.
●When operating the tire pressure warning reset switch, the tire pressure

warning light does not blink 3 times.

●After performing  initialization,  the  tire  pressure warning  light  blinks for

1 minute then stays on while driving about 20 minutes.

If the inflation pressure of each tire is still not displayed, have the vehicle
inspected by your Toyota dealer.

WARNING

■When inspecting or replacing tires

Observe the following precautions to prevent accidents. 
Failure to do so may cause damage to parts of the drive train as well as
dangerous  handling  characteristics,  which  may  lead  to  an  accident
resulting in death or serious injury.
●Do not mix tires of different makes, models or tread patterns. 

Also, do not mix tires of remarkably different treadwear.

●Do not use tire sizes other than those recommended by Toyota.
●Do not mix differently constructed tires (radial, bias-belted or bias-ply

tires).

●Do not mix summer, all season and snow tires.
●Do not use tires that have been used on another vehicle. 

Do not use tires if you do not know how they were used previously.

■When initializing the tire pressure warning system

Do not initialize tire pressure warning system without first adjusting the
tire inflation pressure to the specified level. Otherwise, the tire pressure
warning light may not come on even if the tire inflation pressure is low,
or it may come on when the tire inflation pressure is actually normal.

NOTICE

■Repairing or replacing tires, wheels, tire pressure warning valves,

transmitters and tire valve caps
●When removing or fitting the wheels, tires or the tire pressure warning
valves  and  transmitters, contact  your Toyota dealer  as the  tire pres-
sure warning valves and transmitters may be damaged if not handled
correctly.

●Make sure to install the tire valve caps. If the tire valve caps are not
installed, water could enter the tire pressure warning valves and the
tire pressure warning valves could be bound.

●When replacing tire valve caps, do not use tire valve caps other than

those specified. The cap may become stuck.

■To avoid damage to the tire pressure warning valves and transmit-

ters
When a tire is repaired with liquid sealants, the tire pressure warning
valve  and  transmitter  may  not  operate  properly.  If  a  liquid  sealant  is
used, contact your Toyota dealer or other qualified service shop as soon
as possible. Make sure to replace the tire pressure warning valve and
transmitter when replacing the tire. (P. 406)

■Driving on rough roads

Take particular care when driving on roads with loose surfaces or pot-
holes. 
These conditions may cause losses in tire inflation pressure, reducing
the  cushioning  ability  of  the  tires.  In  addition,  driving  on  rough  roads
may  cause  damage  to  the  tires  themselves,  as  well  as  the  vehicle’s
wheels and body.

■If tire inflation pressure of each tire becomes low while driving
Do not continue driving, or your tires and/or wheels may be ruined.

Remove the tire valve cap.
Press the tip of the tire pressure gauge onto the tire valve.
Read the pressure using the gauge gradations.
If the tire inflation pressure is not at the recommended level, adjust
the pressure.
If you add too much air, press the center of the valve to deflate.
After  completing  the  tire  inflation  pressure  measurement  and
adjustment, apply soapy water to the valve and check for leakage.
Put the tire valve cap back on.

■Tire inflation pressure check interval

You should check tire inflation pressure every two weeks, or at least once
a month. 
Do not forget to check the spare.

■Effects of incorrect tire inflation pressure

Driving with incorrect tire inflation pressure may result in the following:
●Reduced fuel economy
●Reduced driving comfort and poor handling
●Reduced tire life due to wear
●Reduced safety
●Damage to the drive train
If a tire needs frequent inflating, have it checked by your Toyota dealer.

■Instructions for checking tire inflation pressure

When checking tire inflation pressure, observe the following:
●Check only when the tires are cold. 

If  your  vehicle  has  been  parked  for  at  least  3  hours  or  has  not  been
driven for more than 1 mile or 1.5 km, you will get an accurate cold tire
inflation pressure reading.

●Always use a tire pressure gauge. 

It is difficult to judge if a tire is properly inflated based only on its appear-
ance.

●It  is  normal  for  the  tire  inflation  pressure  to  be  higher  after  driving  as
heat is generated in the tire. Do not reduce tire inflation pressure after
driving.

●Passengers and luggage weight should be placed so that the vehicle is

balanced.

WARNING

■Proper inflation is critical to save tire performance

Keep your tires properly inflated. 
If the tires are not properly inflated, the following conditions may occur
which could lead to an accident resulting in death or serious injury:
●Excessive wear
●Uneven wear
●Poor handling
●Possibility of blowouts resulting from overheated tires
●Air leaking from between tire and wheel
●Wheel deformation and/or tire damage
●Greater possibility of tire damage while driving (due to road hazards,

expansion joints, sharp edges in the road, etc.)

NOTICE

■When inspecting and adjusting tire inflation pressure

Be sure to put the tire valve caps back on. 
If a valve cap is not installed, dirt or moisture may get into the valve and
cause an air leak, resulting in decreased tire inflation pressure.

Wheels

If  a  wheel  is  bent,  cracked  or  heavily  corroded,  it  should  be
replaced.  Otherwise,  the  tire  may  separate  from  the  wheel  or
cause a loss of handling control.

Wheel selection
When replacing wheels, care should be taken to ensure that they are
equivalent to those removed in load capacity, diameter, rim width and
inset*. 
Replacement wheels are available at your Toyota dealer.
*: Conventionally referred to as “offset”.
Toyota does not recommend using the following:
● Wheels of different sizes or types
● Used wheels
● Bent wheels that have been straightened
Aluminum wheel precautions
● Use only Toyota wheel nuts and wrenches designed for use with

your aluminum wheels.

● When  rotating,  repairing  or  changing  your  tires,  check  that  the

wheel nuts are still tight after driving 1000 miles (1600 km).

● Be  careful  not  to  damage  the  aluminum  wheels  when  using  tire

chains.

● Use only Toyota genuine balance weights or equivalent and a plas-

tic or rubber hammer when balancing your wheels.

■When replacing wheels

The  wheels  of  your  vehicle  are  equipped  with  tire  pressure  warning
valves  and  transmitters  that  allow  the  tire  pressure  warning  system  to
provide advance warning in the event of a loss in tire inflation pressure.
Whenever wheels are replaced, tire pressure warning valves and trans-
mitters must be installed. (P. 406)

WARNING

■When replacing wheels

●Do not use wheels that are a different size from those recommended in

the Owner’s Manual, as this may result in a loss of handling control.

●Never  use an  inner  tube in  a  leaking  wheel  which  is  designed for a
tubeless tire. Doing so may result in an accident, causing death or seri-
ous injury.

■When installing the wheel nuts

facing 

tapered  ends 

●Be sure to install the wheel nuts with
the 
inward.
Installing  the  nuts  with  the  tapered
ends  facing  outward  can  cause  the
wheel to break and eventually cause
the  wheel  to  come  off  while  driving,
which  could 
to  an  accident
resulting in death or serious injury.

lead 

Tapered 
portion

●Never use oil or grease on the wheel bolts or wheel nuts. 

Oil and grease may cause the wheel nuts to be excessively tightened,
leading to bolt or disc wheel damage. In addition, the oil or grease can
cause the wheel nuts to loosen and the wheel may fall off, causing an
accident  and  resulting  in  death  or  serious  injury.  Remove  any  oil  or
grease from the wheel bolts or wheel nuts.

WARNING

■If both the ABS and the brake system warning lights remain on

Stop your vehicle in a safe place immediately and contact your Toyota
dealer. The vehicle will become extremely unstable during braking, and
the ABS  system  may  fail,  which  could  cause  an  accident  resulting  in
death or serious injury.

■When the power steering system warning light comes on

The steering wheel may become extremely heavy.
If the steering wheel becomes heavier than usual when operating, hold
firmly and operate using more force than usual.

■If the tire pressure warning light comes on

Be  sure  to  observe  the  following  precautions.  Failure  to  do  so  could
cause a loss of vehicle control and result in death or serious injury.
●Stop your vehicle in a safe place as soon as possible. Adjust the tire

inflation pressure immediately.

●If the tire pressure warning light comes on even after tire inflation pres-
sure adjustment, it is probable that you have a flat tire. Check the tires.
If  a  tire  is  flat,  change  it  with  the  spare  tire  and  have  the  flat  tire
repaired by the nearest Toyota dealer.

●Avoid abrupt maneuvering and braking. If the vehicle tires deteriorate,

you could lose control of the steering wheel or the brakes.

■If a blowout or sudden air leakage should occur

The tire pressure warning system may not activate immediately.

SEQUOIA_OM_USA_OM0C013U_19MY

7-2. Steps to take in an emergency

WARNING

■Maintenance of the tires

Each tire, including the spare (if provided), should be checked monthly
when cold  and  inflated  to the  inflation  pressure  recommended  by  the
vehicle  manufacturer  on  the  vehicle  placard  or  tire  inflation  pressure
label (tire and load information label). (If your vehicle has tires of a dif-
ferent size than the size indicated on the vehicle placard or tire inflation
pressure  label  [tire  and  load  information  label],  you  should  determine
the proper tire inflation pressure for those tires.)
As an added safety feature, your vehicle has been equipped with a tire
pressure monitoring system (TPMS-tire pressure warning system) that
illuminates a low tire pressure telltale (tire pressure warning light) when
one  or  more  of  your  tires  is  significantly  under-inflated.  Accordingly,
when  the  low  tire  pressure  telltale  (tire  pressure  warning  light)  illumi-
nates, you should stop and check your tires as soon as possible, and
inflate  them  to  the  proper  pressure.  Driving  on  a  significantly  under-
inflated  tire  causes  the  tire  to  overheat  and  can  lead  to  tire  failure.
Under-inflation also reduces fuel efficiency and tire tread life, and may
affect the vehicle’s handling and stopping ability.
Please note that the TPMS (tire pressure warning system) is not a sub-
stitute for proper tire maintenance, and it is the driver’s responsibility to
maintain correct tire pressure, even if under-inflation has not reached
the level to trigger illumination of the TPMS low tire pressure telltale (tire
pressure warning light).
Your vehicle has also been equipped with a TPMS (tire pressure warn-
ing  system)  malfunction  indicator  to  indicate  when  the  system  is  not
operating properly. The TPMS (tire pressure warning system) malfunc-
tion indicator is combined with the low tire pressure telltale (tire pressure
warning light). When the system detects a malfunction, the telltale will
flash for approximately one minute and then remain continuously illumi-
nated. This sequence will continue upon subsequent vehicle start-ups
as long as the malfunction exists. When the malfunction indicator is illu-
minated, the system may not be able to detect or signal low tire pres-
sure as intended.
TPMS (tire pressure warning system) malfunctions may occur for a vari-
ety of reasons, including the installation of replacement or alternate tires
or wheels on the vehicle that prevent the TPMS (tire pressure warning
system) from functioning properly. Always check the TPMS (tire pres-
sure  warning  system)  malfunction  telltale  after  replacing  one  or  more
tires or wheels on your vehicle to ensure that the replacement or alter-
nate tires and wheels allow the TPMS (tire pressure warning system) to
continue to function properly.

WARNING

■Replacing a flat tire

●Observe the following precautions. 

Failure to do so may result in serious injury:
• Lower  the  spare  tire  completely  to  the  ground  before  removing  it

from under the vehicle.

• Do not try to remove the wheel ornament by hand. Take due care in

handling the ornament to avoid unexpected personal injury.

• Do not attach a heavily damaged wheel ornament, as it may fly off

the wheel while the vehicle is moving.

• Do not touch the disc wheels or the area around the brakes immedi-

ately after the vehicle has been driven. 
After  the  vehicle  has  been  driven  the  disc  wheels  and  the  area
around the brakes will be extremely hot. Touching these areas with
hands, feet or other body parts while changing a tire, etc. may result
in burns.

●Failure  to  follow  these  precautions  could  cause  the  wheel  nuts  to

loosen and the tire to fall off, resulting in death or serious injury.
• Have the wheel nuts tightened with a torque wrench as soon as pos-

sible after changing wheels.
Steel wheel: 154 ft·lbf (209 N·m, 21.3 kgf·m)
Aluminum wheel: 97 ft·lbf (131 N·m, 13.4 kgf·m)

• When installing a tire, only use wheel nuts that have been specifi-

cally designed for that wheel.

• If  there  are  any  cracks  or  deformations  in  the  bolt  screws,  nut
threads  or  bolt  holes  of  the  wheel,  have  the  vehicle  inspected  by
your Toyota dealer.

• When  installing  the  wheel  nuts,  be  sure  to  install  them  with  the

■ Engine oil selection

“Toyota  Genuine  Motor  Oil”  is  used  in  your  Toyota  vehicle.  Use
Toyota approved “Toyota Genuine Motor Oil” or equivalent to sat-
isfy the following grade and viscosity.
Oil grade: ILSAC GF-5 multigrade engine oil
Recommended viscosity: SAE 0W-20
SAE  0W-20  is  the  best  choice
for  good  fuel  economy  and
good starting in cold weather.
If  SAE  0W-20  is  not  available,
SAE  5W-20  oil  may  be  used.
However,  it  must  be  replaced
with SAE 0W-20 at the next oil
change.

Oil viscosity (0W-20 is explained here as an example):
• The  0W  in  0W-20  indicates  the  characteristic  of  the  oil  which
allows cold startability. Oils with a lower value before the W allow
for easier starting of the engine in cold weather.

• The 20 in 0W-20 indicates the viscosity characteristic of the oil
when the oil is at high temperature. An oil with a higher viscosity
(one with a higher value) may be better suited if the vehicle is
operated at high speeds, or under extreme load conditions.

How to read oil container label: 
The International Lubricant Speci-
Committee
fication  Advisory 
(ILSAC)  Certification  Mark 
is
added  to  some  oil  containers  to
help you select the oil you should
use.

Fuel information

You must only use unleaded gasoline. 
Select octane rating 87 (Research Octane Number 91) or higher.
Use  of  unleaded  gasoline  with  an  octane  rating  lower  than  87
may result in engine knocking. Persistent knocking can lead to
engine damage.
At minimum, the gasoline you use should meet the specifications of
ASTM D4814 in the U.S.A.

■Gasoline quality

In very few cases, driveability problems may be caused by the brand of gaso-
line you are using. If driveability problems persist, try changing the brand of
gasoline. If this does not correct the problem, consult your Toyota dealer.

■Recommendation of the use of gasoline containing detergent additives
●Toyota recommends the use of gasoline that contains detergent additives to

avoid the build-up of engine deposits.

●All  gasoline  sold  in  the  U.S.A.  contains  minimum  detergent  additives  to
clean and/or keep clean intake systems, per EPA’s lowest additives concen-
tration program.

●Toyota strongly recommends the use of Top Tier Detergent Gasoline. For
more information on Top Tier  Detergent Gasoline  and a list of marketers,
please go to the official website www.toptiergas.com.

■Recommendation of the use of low emissions gasoline

Gasolines  containing  oxygenates  such  as  ethers  and  ethanol,  as  well  as
reformulated gasolines, are available in some cities. These fuels are typically
acceptable for use, providing they meet other fuel requirements.
Toyota  recommends  these  fuels,  since  the  formulations  allow  for  reduced
vehicle emissions.

■Non-recommendation of the use of blended gasoline

●Use only gasoline containing up to 15%

ethanol. 
DO  NOT  use  any  flex-fuel  or  gasoline
that could contain more than 15% etha-
nol,  including  from  any  pump  labeled
E30,  E50,  E85  (which  are  only  some
examples  of  fuel  containing  more  than
15% ethanol).

DO NOT use gasoline 
containing more than 
15% ethanol.

(30% ethanol)

(50% ethanol)

(85% ethanol)

●If you use gasohol in your vehicle, be sure that it has an octane rating no

lower than 87.

●Toyota does not recommend the use of gasoline containing methanol.

■Non-recommendation of the use of gasoline containing MMT

Some gasoline contains an octane enhancing additive called MMT (Methylcy-
clopentadienyl Manganese Tricarbonyl).
Toyota does not recommend the use of gasoline that contains MMT. If fuel
containing  MMT  is  used,  your  emission  control  system  may  be  adversely
affected.
The malfunction indicator lamp on the instrument cluster may come on. If this
happens, contact your Toyota dealer for service.

■If your engine knocks

●Consult your Toyota dealer.
●You may occasionally notice light knocking for a short time while accelerat-

ing or driving uphill. This is normal and there is no need for concern.

●Do not use leaded gasoline. 

●Do not use improper fuels. If improper fuels are used, the engine will be

Leaded gasoline can cause damage to your vehicle’s three-way catalytic
converters causing the emission control system to malfunction.

●Do not use gasohol other than the type previously stated. 

Other  gasohol  may  cause  fuel  system  damage  or  vehicle  performance
problems.

●Using unleaded gasoline with an octane number or rating lower than the

level previously stated will cause persistent heavy knocking.
At worst, this will lead to engine damage.

■Fuel-related poor driveability

If poor driveability (poor hot starting, vaporization, engine knocking, etc.) is
encountered after using a different type of fuel, discontinue the use of that
type of fuel.

■When refueling with gasohol

Take care not to spill gasohol. It can damage your vehicle’s paint.

Uniform Tire Quality Grading
This  information  has  been  prepared  in  accordance  with  regulations
issued  by  the  National  Highway Traffic  Safety Administration  of  the
U.S. Department of Transportation. 
It  provides  the  purchasers  and/or  prospective  purchasers  of Toyota
vehicles with information on uniform tire quality grading.

Your Toyota dealer will help answer any questions you may have  as
you read this information.

■ DOT quality grades

All passenger vehicle tires must conform to Federal Safety Require-
ments  in  addition  to  these  grades.  Quality  grades  can  be  found
where applicable on the tire sidewall between tread shoulder and
maximum section width.

For example: Treadwear 200 Traction AA Temperature A

■ Treadwear

The  treadwear  grade  is  a  comparative  rating  based  on  the  wear
rate of the tire when tested under controlled conditions on a speci-
fied government test course.

For example, a tire graded 150 would wear one and a half (1 - 1/2)
times as well on the government course as a tire graded 100. 
The  relative  performance  of  tires  depends  upon  the  actual  condi-
tions of their use. Performance may differ significantly from the norm
due to variations in driving habits, service practices and differences
in road characteristics and climate.

■ Traction AA, A, B, C

The  traction  grades,  from  highest  to  lowest,  are AA, A,  B  and  C,
and  they  represent  the  tire’s  ability  to  stop  on  wet  pavement  as
measured under controlled conditions on specified government test
surfaces of asphalt and concrete.

A tire marked C may have poor traction performance.
Warning: The traction grade assigned to this tire is based on braking
(straight ahead) traction tests and does not include cornering (turn-
ing) traction.

SEQUOIA_OM_USA_OM0C013U_19MY

8-1. Specifications

509

■ Temperature A, B, C

The temperature grades are A (the highest), B, and C, representing
the tire’s resistance to the generation of heat and its ability to dissi-
pate heat when tested under controlled conditions on a specified
indoor laboratory test wheel.

Sustained  high  temperature  can  cause  the  material  of  the  tire  to
degenerate and reduce tire life, and excessive temperature can lead
to sudden tire failure.
Grade C corresponds to a level of performance which all passenger
car tires must meet under the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Stan-
dard No. 109.
Grades B and A represent higher levels of performance on the labo-
ratory test wheel than the minimum required by law.
Warning: The temperature grades of a tire assume that it is properly
inflated and not overloaded. 
Excessive speed, underinflation, or excessive loading, either sepa-
rately  or in combination, can cause heat  buildup and possible  tire
failure.

être en contact avec le cou ou
glisser de l’épaule.

● Placez la sangle abdominale le
les

plus  bas  possible  sur 
hanches.

Entretien et soin
■ Ceintures de sécurité

Avec un tissu ou une éponge, nettoyez à l’aide d’un savon doux et
de l’eau tiède. Vérifiez aussi les ceintures régulièrement pour vous
assurer qu’elles ne présentent pas d’usure excessive, d’effilochage
ou de coupures.

AVERTISSEMENT

■État et usure des ceintures de sécurité

Inspectez les ceintures de sécurité périodiquement. Contrôlez qu’elles ne
sont  pas  entaillées,  effilochées,  et  que  leurs  ancrages  ne  sont  pas
desserrés.  Ne  pas  utiliser  une  ceinture  de  sécurité  défectueuse  avant
qu’elle ne soit remplacée. Une ceinture de sécurité défectueuse n’apporte
aucune garantie de protection de l’occupant contre des blessures graves,
voire mortelles.

Votre  véhicule  est  équipé  de  COUSSINS  GONFLABLES
INTELLIGENTS (ADVANCED AIRBAGS) conçus selon les normes de
sécurité  américaines  applicables  aux  véhicules  à  moteur
(FMVSS208).  Le  boîtier  électronique  de  coussins  gonflables  (ECU)
utilise  les  informations  reçues  des  capteurs,  etc.  détaillés  dans  le
schéma  ci-dessus  de  composition  du  système  pour  commander  le
déploiement des coussins gonflables. Ces informations comprennent
des  informations  sur  la  gravité  de  la  collision  et  les  occupants.  Le
déploiement  rapide  des  coussins  gonflables  est  obtenu  au  moyen
d’une  réaction  chimique  dans  les  dispositifs  pyrotechniques,  qui
produit  un  gaz  inoffensif  permettant  d’amortir  le  mouvement  des
occupants.

AVERTISSEMENT

■Précautions avec les coussins gonflables SRS

Respectez  les  précautions  suivantes  concernant  les  coussins  gonflables
SRS. 
À défaut, des blessures graves, voire mortelles, pourraient s’ensuivre.
●Le conducteur et tous les passagers à bord du véhicule doivent porter leur
ceinture de sécurité correctement. 
Les  coussins  gonflables  SRS  sont  des  dispositifs  de  protection
complémentaires aux ceintures de sécurité.

●Le  coussin  gonflable  SRS  conducteur  se  déploie  avec  une  puissance
considérable et peut occasionner des blessures graves, voire mortelles,
notamment  lorsque  le  conducteur  se  trouve  très  près  du  coussin
gonflable.  L’autorité  fédérale  chargée  de  la  sécurité  routière  aux  États-
Unis, la NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) conseille:
Sachant que la zone de danger pour le coussin gonflable conducteur se
trouve dans les premiers 2 à 3 in. (50 à 75 mm) du déploiement, placez-
vous  à  10  in.  (250 mm)  du  coussin  gonflable  conducteur  pour  garantir
une marge de sécurité suffisante. Cette distance est à mesurer entre le
moyeu du volant de direction et le sternum. Si vous êtes assis à moins de
10  in.  (250  mm),  vous  pouvez  changer  votre  position  de  conduite  de
plusieurs façons:
• Reculez  votre  siège  le  plus  possible,  tout  en  continuant  à  pouvoir

atteindre confortablement les pédales.

• Inclinez légèrement le dossier du siège. 

Bien que les véhicules soient différents les uns des autres, la plupart
des conducteurs peuvent s’asseoir à une distance de 10 in. (250 mm),
même avec le siège conducteur complètement avancé, simplement en
inclinant un peu le dossier de siège. Si vous avez des difficultés à voir
la  route  après  avoir  incliné  votre  siège,  utilisez  un  coussin  ferme  et
antidérapant pour vous rehausser ou, si votre véhicule est équipé du
réglage en hauteur du siège, remontez-le.
• Si  votre  volant  de  direction  est  réglable,  inclinez-le  vers  le  bas.  Cela
vous permet d’orienter le coussin gonflable vers votre buste plutôt que
vers la tête et le cou.

Le  siège  doit  être  réglé  selon  les  recommandations  de  la  NHTSA  ci-
dessus, tout en conservant le contrôle des pédales et du volant, et la vue
des commandes au tableau de bord.

AVERTISSEMENT

■Précautions avec les coussins gonflables SRS

les 

dite, 

●Si  vous  attachez  une  rallonge  de
ceinture  de  sécurité  aux  boucles  des
ceintures de sièges avant, mais pas au
pêne  de 
la  ceinture  de  sécurité
proprement 
coussins
gonflables  SRS  frontaux  déterminent
que le conducteur et le passager avant
portent  leur  ceinture  de  sécurité,  alors
même qu’elle n’est pas attachée. Dans
ce  cas,  les  coussins  gonflables  SRS
frontaux risquent de ne pas se déployer
correctement  en  cas  de  collision,
causant  des  blessures  graves,  voire
mortelles. Veillez à porter la ceinture de
sécurité avec la rallonge de ceinture de
sécurité.

●Le coussin gonflable SRS passager avant se déploie également avec une
puissance considérable et peut occasionner des blessures graves, voire
mortelles,  notamment  lorsque  le  passager  avant  se  trouve  très  près  du
coussin gonflable. Le siège du passager avant doit se trouver le plus loin
possible du coussin gonflable et le dossier doit être réglé de manière à ce
que le passager avant soit assis bien droit.

●Le déploiement d’un coussin gonflable peut infliger des blessures graves,
voire  mortelles,  aux  nourrissons  et  aux  enfants  mal  assis  et/ou  mal
attachés. Installez dans un siège de sécurité enfant les enfants trop jeunes
pour pouvoir utiliser la ceinture de sécurité. Toyota recommande vivement
que tous les nourrissons et enfants soient installés dans les sièges arrière
du véhicule et convenablement attachés. Les sièges arrière sont plus sûrs
pour les nourrissons et les enfants que le siège passager avant.

●N’installez jamais un siège de sécurité enfant type dos à la route sur le
siège passager avant, même si le témoin indicateur “AIR BAG OFF” est
allumé. 
En cas d’accident, la force exercée par le déploiement rapide du coussin
gonflable  passager  avant  peut  causer  des  blessures  graves,  voire
mortelles à un enfant, si le siège de sécurité enfant type dos à la route est
installé sur le siège passager avant.

●Ne pas s’asseoir sur le bord du siège et
ne pas s’appuyer contre la planche de
bord.

AVERTISSEMENT

■Précautions avec les coussins gonflables SRS

●Ne pas laisser un enfant rester debout
devant 
le  coussin  gonflable  SRS
passager avant ni assis sur les genoux
du passager avant.

●Ne pas laisser les occupants des sièges
avant  voyager  avec  un  objet  sur  les
genoux.

●Ne pas s’appuyer contre la porte, contre
le  rail  latéral  de  toit  ou  contre  les
montants avant, latéraux et arrière.

●Interdisez à quiconque de s’agenouiller
sur le siège passager en appui contre la
porte ou de sortir la tête ou les mains à
l’extérieur du véhicule.

●Ne rien fixer ou disposer sur la planche
de bord, la garniture centrale du moyeu
de  volant  de  direction  et  la  partie
inférieure du tableau de bord. 
Lors  du  déploiement  des  coussins
gonflables  SRS  conducteur,  passager
avant et de genoux, tout objet risque de
se transformer en projectile.

●Ne  rien  fixer  aux  portes,  à  la  vitre  de
pare-brise,  aux  vitres  latérales,  aux
montants avant et arrière, au rail latéral
de toit et à la poignée de maintien.

AVERTISSEMENT

■Précautions avec les coussins gonflables SRS

●Ne  pas  attacher  à  la  clé  des  objets
lourds,  pointus  ou  très  durs,  comme
d’autres  clés  par  exemple.  Ces  objets
risquent  d’entraver  le  déploiement  du
coussin  gonflable  SRS  de  genoux  ou
d’être projetés vers le siège conducteur
par la force de déploiement, constituant
ainsi un danger potentiel.

●Ne pas suspendre aux crochets à vêtements un cintre nu ni aucun objet
dur  ou  tranchant.  En  cas  de  déploiement  des  coussins  gonflables  SRS
rideau, tous ces objets pourraient se transformer en projectiles et causer
des blessures graves, voire mortelles.

●Si une housse en vinyle recouvre la partie où le coussins gonflable SRS

de genoux se déploie, veillez à l’enlever.

●N’utilisez pour les sièges aucun accessoire venant recouvrir les parties où
se  déploient  les  coussins  gonflables  SRS  latéraux,  car  il risquerait  d’en
gêner le déploiement. De tels accessoires peuvent empêcher les coussins
gonflables latéraux de fonctionner correctement, neutraliser le système ou
provoquer  le  déploiement  accidentel  des  coussins  gonflables  latéraux,
provoquant ainsi des blessures graves, voire mortelles.

●Évitez de faire subir des chocs ou des pressions excessives aux zones
renfermant les composants des coussins gonflables SRS. 
En effet, cela pourrait entraîner un mauvais fonctionnement des coussins
gonflables SRS.

●Ne  touchez  aucun  composant  du  système  immédiatement  après  le
déclenchement (déploiement) des coussins gonflables SRS, car ils sont
alors encore très chauds.

●Si vous avez des difficultés à respirer après le déploiement des coussins
gonflables  SRS,  ouvrez  une porte  ou  une  vitre  pour faire  entrer  de  l’air
frais, ou bien descendez du véhicule si cela ne présente pas de danger.
Retirez tout résidu dès que possible afin d’éviter d’éventuelles irritations
de la peau. 

●Si  les  parties  renfermant  les  coussins  gonflables  SRS,  telles  que  la
garniture  centrale  du  volant  de  direction  et  les  garnitures  de  montants
avant et arrière, apparaissent abîmées ou craquelées, faites-les remplacer
par votre concessionnaire Toyota.

●Ne  rien  poser  sur  le  siège  du  passager  avant,  comme  un  coussin  par
exemple. Cela a pour conséquence de répartir le poids du passager sur
toute  la  surface  du  siège,  ce  qui  empêche  le  capteur  de  détecter
normalement  le  poids  du  passager.  En  conséquence,  les  coussins
gonflables SRS frontaux du passager avant peuvent ne pas se déployer
en cas de collision.

modifications suivantes sans consulter votre concessionnaire Toyota. Les
coussins gonflables SRS peuvent ne pas fonctionner correctement ou se
déployer  (se  gonfler)  accidentellement,  provoquant  ainsi  des  blessures
graves, voire mortelles.
