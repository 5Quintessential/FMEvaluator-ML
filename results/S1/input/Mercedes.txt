distance from the vehicle in front.

# Avoid frequent, sudden acceleration

and braking.

# Change gear in good time and use each

gear only up to Ô of its maximum
engine speed.

# Switch off the engine in stationary traf‐

fic, e.g. by using the ECO start/stop
function.

# Drive fuel-efficiently. Observe the ECO
display for a fuel-efficient driving style.

R The vehicle is driven too fast over an

obstacle, e.g. a curb, speed bump or pot‐
hole

R A heavy object strikes the underbody or

chassis components

In situations such as this, the body, the
underbody, chassis components, wheels or
tires could be damaged without the damage
being visible. Components damaged in this

way can unexpectedly fail or, in the case of
an accident, may not absorb the loads that
arise as intended.
If the underbody paneling is damaged, flam‐
mable materials such as leaves, grass or
twigs can collect between the underbody and
the underbody paneling. These materials may
ignite if they come into contact with hot
parts on the exhaust system.

The QR code is secured in the fuel filler flap and
on the opposite side on the B-pillar. In the event
of an accident, rescue services can use the QR
code to quickly find the appropriate rescue card
for your vehicle. The current rescue card con‐
tains the most important information about your
vehicle in a compact form, e.g. the routing of the
electric lines.
Further information can be obtained at http://
www.mercedes-benz.de/qr-code.

Data storage
Electronic control units
Electronic control units are installed in your vehi‐
cle. Some of these are necessary for the safe
operation of your vehicle, while some assist you
when driving (driver assistance systems). In
addition, your vehicle provides comfort and
entertainment functions, which are also made
possible by electronic control units.
Electronic control units contain data memories
which can temporarily or permanently store

technical information about the vehicle's operat‐
ing state, component loads, maintenance
requirements and technical events or malfunc‐
tions.
In general, this information documents the state
of a component part, a module, a system or the
surroundings such as:
R Operating status of system components (e.g.

fill levels, battery status, tire pressure)

R Status messages concerning the vehicle or
its individual components (e.g. number of
wheel revolutions/speed, longitudinal accel‐
eration, lateral acceleration, display of fas‐
tened seat belts)

R Malfunctions or faults in important system

components (e.g. lights, brakes)

R Information on events leading to vehicle

R System reactions in special driving situations
(e.g. airbag deployment, intervention of sta‐
bility control systems)

R Ambient conditions (e.g. temperature, rain

damage

sensor)

In addition to providing the actual control unit
function, this data assists the manufacturer in
detecting and rectifying malfunctions and opti‐
mizing vehicle functions. The majority of this
data is temporary and is only processed in the
vehicle itself. Only a small portion of the data is
stored in the event or fault memory.
When your vehicle is serviced, technical data
from the vehicle can be read out by service net‐
work employees (e.g. workshops, manufactur‐
ers) or third parties (e.g. breakdown services).
Services include repair services, maintenance
processes, warranty claims and quality assur‐
ance measures, for example. The read out is per‐
formed via the legally prescribed port for the
diagnostics connection in the vehicle. The
respective service network locations or third
parties collect, process and use the data. They
document technical statuses of the vehicle,
assist in finding malfunctions and improving
quality and are transmitted to the manufacturer,
if necessary. Furthermore, the manufacturer is
subject to product liability. For this, the manu‐
facturer requires technical data from vehicles.

Fault memories in the vehicle can be reset by a
service outlet as part of repair or maintenance
work.
Depending on the selected equipment, you can
import data into vehicle convenience and info‐
tainment functions yourself.
This includes, for example:
R Multimedia data such as music, films or pho‐
tos for playback in an integrated multimedia
system

R Address book data for use in connection with

an integrated hands-free system or an inte‐
grated navigation system

R Entered navigation destinations
R Data about the use of Internet services
This data can be saved locally in the vehicle or it
is located on a device which you have connected
to the vehicle (e.g. a smartphone, USB flash
drive or MP3 player). If this data is stored in the
vehicle, you can delete it at any time. This data
is sent to third parties only at your request, par‐
ticularly when you use online services in accord‐
ance with the settings that you have selected.

General notes

You can store or change convenience settings/
individualization in the vehicle at any time.
Depending on the equipment, this includes, for
example:
R Settings for the seat and steering wheel posi‐

tions

R Suspension and climate control settings
R Customizations such as interior lighting
If your vehicle is accordingly equipped, you can
connect your smartphone or another mobile end
device to the vehicle. You can control this by
means of the control elements integrated in the
vehicle. Images and audio from the smartphone
can be output via the multimedia system. Cer‐
tain information is simultaneously transferred to

back. There is no further interaction between the
smartphone and the vehicle; in particular, vehi‐
cle data is not directly accessible. Which type of
further data processing occurs is determined by
the provider of the specific app used. Which set‐
tings you can make, if any, depends on the spe‐
cific app and the operating system of your
smartphone.

Online services
Wireless network connection
If your vehicle has a wireless network connec‐
tion, it enables data to be exchanged between
your vehicle and additional systems. The wire‐
less network connection is enabled via the vehi‐
cle's transmission and reception unit or via con‐
nected mobile end devices (e.g. smartphones).
Online functions can be used via the wireless
network connection. This includes online serv‐
ices and applications/apps provided by the man‐
ufacturer or other providers.
Manufacturer's services
Regarding online services of the manufacturer,
the individual functions are described by the

manufacturer in a suitable place (e.g. Operator's
Manual, website of the manufacturer) along with
the relevant data protection information. Per‐
sonal data may be used for the provision of
online services. Data is exchanged via a secure
connection, e.g. the manufacturer's designated
IT systems. Personal data is collected, pro‐
cessed and used via the provision of services
exclusively on the basis of legal permissions or
with prior consent.
The services and functions (sometimes subject
to a fee) can usually be activated or deactivated.
In some cases, this also applies to the entire
vehicle's data connection. This excludes, in par‐
ticular, legally prescribed functions and services.
Third party services
If it is possible to use online services from other
providers, these services are the responsibility
of the provider in question and subject to that
provider's data protection conditions and terms
of use. The manufacturer has no influence on
the content exchanged.
For this reason, please ask the service provider
for information about the type, extent and pur‐

pose of the collection and use of personal data
when services are provided by third parties.

MBUX multimedia system/Mercedes me
connect
If the vehicle is equipped with the MBUX multi‐
media system or Mercedes me connect, addi‐
tional data about the vehicle's operation, the use
of the vehicle in certain situations, and the loca‐
tion of the vehicle may be compiled by the
MBUX multimedia system or Mercedes me con‐
nect.
For additional information, please refer to the
"MBUX multimedia system" section and/or the

Event data recorders
USA only:
This vehicle is equipped with an event data
recorder (EDR). The main purpose of an EDR is
to record, in certain crash or near crash-like sit‐
uations, such as an airbag deployment or hitting
a road obstacle, data that will assist in under‐

standing how a vehicle's systems performed.
The EDR is designed to record data related to
vehicle dynamics and safety systems for a short
period of time, typically 30 seconds or less.
The EDR in this vehicle is designed to record
such data as:
R How various systems in your vehicle were

operating

R Whether or not the driver and front

passenger seat belts were buckled/fastened

R How far (if at all) the driver was depressing

the accelerator and/or brake pedal and

R How fast the vehicle was traveling
This data can help provide a better understand‐
ing of the circumstances in which accidents and
injuries occur. NOTE: EDR data is recorded by
your vehicle only if a non-trivial crash situation
occurs; no data is recorded by the EDR under
normal driving conditions and no personal data
(e.g. name, gender, age and accident location) is
recorded. However, other parties, such as law
enforcement, could combine EDR data with the
type of personally identifying data routinely
acquired during a crash investigation.

To read data recorded by an EDR, special equip‐
ment is required, and access to the vehicle or
the EDR is needed. In addition to the vehicle
manufacturer, other parties that have the special
equipment, such as law enforcement, can read
the information by accessing the vehicle or the
EDR.
EDR data may be used in civil and criminal mat‐
ters as a tool in accident reconstruction, acci‐
dent claims and vehicle safety. Since the Crash
Data Retrieval (CDR) tool that is used to extract
data from the EDR is commercially available,
Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC ("MBUSA") expressly
disclaims any and all liability arising from the
extraction of this information by unauthorized
Mercedes-Benz personnel.
MBUSA will not share EDR data with others with‐
out the consent of the vehicle owner or, if the
vehicle is leased, without the consent of the les‐
see. Exceptions to this representation include
responses to subpoenas by law enforcement; by
federal, state or local government; in connection
with or arising out of litigation involving MBUSA
or its subsidiaries and affiliates; or, as required
by law.

Warning: The EDR is a component of the
Restraint System Module. Tampering with, alter‐
ing, modifying or removing the EDR component
may result in a malfunction of the Restraint Sys‐
tem Module and other systems.
State laws or regulations regarding EDRs that
conflict with federal regulation are pre-empted.
This means that in the event of such conflict, the

Restraint system
Protection by the restraint system
The restraint system includes the following com‐
ponents:
R Seat belt system
R Airbags
R Child restraint system
R Child seat securing systems
The restraint system can help prevent the vehi‐
cle occupants from coming into contact with
parts of the vehicle interior in the event of an
accident. In the event of an accident, the
restraint system can also reduce the forces to
which the vehicle occupants are subjected.
A seat belt can only provide the best level of pro‐
tection if it is worn correctly. Depending on the
detected accident situation, Emergency Tension‐
ing Devices and/or airbags supplement the pro‐
tection offered by a correctly worn seat belt.
Emergency Tensioning Devices and/or airbags
are not deployed in every accident.

In order for the restraint system to provide the
intended level of protection, each vehicle occu‐
pant must observe the following information:
R Fasten seat belts correctly.
R Sit in an almost upright seat position with

their back against the seat backrest.

R Sit with their feet resting on the floor, if pos‐

sible.

R Always secure persons under 5 ft (1.50 m)

tall in an additional restraint system suitable
for Mercedes-Benz vehicles.

However, no system available today can com‐
pletely eliminate injuries and fatalities in every
accident situation. In particular, the seat belt
and airbag generally do not protect against
objects penetrating the vehicle from the outside.
It is also not possible to completely rule out the
risk of injury caused by the airbag deploying.

Reduced restraint system protection

& WARNING Risk of injury or death from

modifications to the restraint system

The restraint system can no longer function
correctly after alterations have been made.
The restraint system may then not protect
the vehicle occupants as intended by failing
in an accident or triggering unexpectedly, for
example
# Never alter the parts of the restraint

system.

# Never tamper with the wiring or any
electronic component parts or their
software.

If it is necessary to modify the vehicle to accom‐
modate a person with disabilities, contact an
authorized Mercedes-Benz Center for details.

gered unintentionally or may not deploy as
intended during an accident. This may affect
the Emergency Tensioning Devices or air‐
bags, for example.
# Have the restraint system checked and
repaired immediately at a qualified spe‐
cialist workshop.

Malfunctioning restraint system
A malfunction has occurred in the restraint sys‐
tem if:
R The 6 restraint system warning lamp

does not light up when the ignition is
switched on

R The 6 restraint system warning lamp

lights up continuously or repeatedly during a
journey

& WARNING Risk of injury due to malfunc‐

tions in the restraint system

If the restraint system is malfunctioning,
restraint system components may be trig‐

Function of the restraint system in an acci‐
dent
How the restraint system works is determined by
the severity of the impact detected and the type
of accident anticipated:
R Frontal impact
R Rear impact
R Side impact
R Rollover
The activation thresholds for the components of
the restraint system are determined based on
the evaluation of the sensor values measured at
various points in the vehicle. This process is pre-
emptive in nature. The triggering/deployment of

the components of the restraint system must
take place in good time at the start of the colli‐
sion.
Factors which can only be seen and measured
after a collision has occurred do not play a deci‐
sive role in the deployment of an airbag. Nor do
they provide an indication of airbag deployment.
The vehicle may be deformed significantly with‐
out an airbag being deployed. This is the case if
only parts which are relatively easily deformed
are affected and the rate of vehicle deceleration
is not high. Conversely, an airbag may be
deployed even though the vehicle suffers only
minor deformation. If very rigid vehicle parts
such as longitudinal members are hit, for exam‐
ple, this may result in sufficiently high levels of
vehicle deceleration.

The components of the restraint system can
be activated or deployed independently of
each other:

the journey, that the status of the front
passenger airbag is correct (/ page 45).

& WARNING Risk of burns from hot air bag

components

The air bag parts are hot after an air bag has
been deployed.
# Do not touch the air bag parts.
# Have a deployed air bag replaced at a
qualified specialist workshop as soon
as possible.

Mercedes-Benz recommends that you have the
vehicle towed to a qualified specialist workshop
after an accident. Take this into account, partic‐
ularly if an Emergency Tensioning Device is trig‐
gered or an airbag deployed.
If the Emergency Tensioning Devices are trig‐
gered or an airbag is deployed, you will hear a
bang, and a small amount of powder may also be
released:
R The bang will not generally affect your hear‐

R In general, the powder released is not haz‐
ardous to health but may cause short-term
breathing difficulties to persons suffering
from asthma or other pulmonary conditions.
Provided it is safe to do so, leave the vehicle
immediately or open the window in order to
prevent breathing difficulties.

Airbags and pyrotechnic Emergency Tensioning
Devices contain perchlorate material, which may
require special handling or environmental pro‐
tection measures. National guidelines regarding
waste disposal must be observed. In California,
see http://www.dtsc.ca.gov/HazardousWaste/
Perchlorate/index.cfm.

Seat belts
Protection provided by the seat belt
Always fasten your seat belt correctly before
starting a journey. A seat belt can only provide
the best level of protection if it is worn correctly.

36 Occupant safety

& WARNING Risk of injury or death due to

incorrectly fastened seat belt

If the seat belt is not worn correctly, it can‐
not perform its intended protective function.
In addition, an incorrectly fastened seat belt
can also cause injuries, for example, in the
event of an accident or when braking or
changing direction suddenly.
# Always ensure that all vehicle occu‐
pants have their seat belts fastened
correctly and are sitting properly.

Always observe the instructions about the cor‐
rect driver's seat position and adjusting the
seats (/ page 94).
In order for the correctly worn seat belt to pro‐
vide the intended level of protection, each vehi‐
cle occupant must observe the following infor‐
mation:
R The seat belt must not be twisted and must

fit tightly and snugly across the body.

R The seat belt must be routed across the cen‐

ter of the shoulder and as low down across
the hips as possible.

R The shoulder section of the seat belt should

not touch your neck nor be routed under
your arm or behind your back.

R Avoid wearing bulky clothing, e.g. a winter

coat.

R Push the lap belt down as far as possible

across your hips and pull tight with the shoul‐
der section of the belt. Never route the lap
belt across your abdomen.
Pregnant women must also take particular
care with this.

R Never route the seat belt across sharp, poin‐

ted, abrasive or fragile objects.

R Only one person may use each seat belt at

any one time. Infants and children must
never travel sitting on the lap of a vehicle
occupant.

R Never secure objects with a seat belt if the
seat belt is being used by one of the vehi‐
cle's occupants. Always observe the instruc‐

tions for loading the vehicle when securing
objects, luggage or loads (/ page 106).
Also ensure that no objects, e.g. a cushion,
are ever placed between a person and the
seat.

The seat belts on the following seats are equip‐
ped with a special seatbelt retractor:
R Co-driver seat
R Rear seats
Activate or deactivate the special seatbelt
retractor of the seat belt (/ page 55).
If children are traveling in the vehicle, be sure to
observe the instructions and safety notes on
"Children in the vehicle" (/ page 50).

Limitations of the protection provided by the
seat belt

& WARNING Risk of injury or death due to

incorrect seat position

The seat belt does not offer the intended
level of protection if you have not moved the
seat backrest to an almost vertical position.
When braking or in the event of an accident,
you could slide underneath the seat belt and
sustain abdominal or neck injuries, for exam‐
ple.
# Adjust the seat properly before begin‐

ning your journey.

# Always ensure that the seat backrest is

in an almost vertical position and that
the shoulder section of your seat belt is
routed across the center of your shoul‐
der.

& WARNING Risk of injury or death when
additional restraint systems are not used
for persons with a smaller build

Persons under 5 ft (1.50 m) tall cannot wear
the seat belt correctly without a suitable
additional restraint system.
If the seat belt is not worn correctly, it can‐
not perform its intended protective function.
In addition, an incorrectly fastened seat belt
can also cause injuries, for example, in the
event of an accident or when braking or
changing direction suddenly.
# Always secure persons under 5 ft

(1.50 m) tall in a suitable restraint sys‐
tem.

& WARNING Risk of injury or death due to

damaged or modified seat belts

Seat belts cannot provide protection in the
following situations:
R The seat belt is damaged, has been modi‐
fied, is extremely dirty, bleached or dyed

Occupant safety

37

R The seat belt buckle is damaged or

extremely dirty

R Modifications have been made to the

Emergency Tensioning Device, seat belt
anchorage or seat belt retractor

Seat belts may sustain non-visible damage in
an accident, e.g. due to glass splinters.
Modified or damaged seat belts could tear or
fail in the event of an accident, for example.
Modified Emergency Tensioning Devices may
be deployed unintentionally or not function
as intended.
# Never modify the seat belts, Emergency

Tensioning Devices, seat belt ancho‐
rages or seat belt retractors.

# Make sure that the seat belts are not
damaged, are not worn and are clean.

# Always have the seat belts checked
immediately after an accident at a

38 Occupant safety

& WARNING Risk of injury or death from
deployed pyrotechnic Emergency Ten‐
sioning Devices

Pyrotechnic Emergency Tensioning Devices
that have been deployed are no longer opera‐
tional and are unable to perform their inten‐
ded protective function.
# Therefore, have deployed pyrotechnic

Emergency Tensioning Devices immedi‐
ately replaced at a qualified specialist
workshop.

Mercedes-Benz recommends that you have the
vehicle towed to a qualified specialist workshop
after an accident.

* NOTE Damage caused by trapping the

seat belt

If an unused seat belt is not fully retracted, it
may become trapped in the door or in the
seat mechanism.
# Always ensure that an unused seat belt

is fully retracted.

Releasing the rear passenger compartment
center seat belt
If the left-hand rear seat backrest is folded down
and back up again, it may not be possible to pull
out the rear passenger compartment center seat
belt. The seat belt must be released.
# Pull the seat belt out approximately 1 in

(25 mm) at the seat belt outlet on the seat
backrest and then release it again.
The seat belt is retracted and released.

Fastening and adjusting the seat belts
If the seat belt is pulled quickly or sharply, the
seat belt retractor locks. The seat belt strap can‐
not be pulled out any further.

# Always engage seat belt tongue 2 of the

seat belt into seat belt buckle 1 of the cor‐
responding seat.

# Press and hold the seat belt outlet release

and slide seat belt outlet 3 into the desired

& WARNING Risk of injury or fatal injuries
if the front-passenger airbag is enabled

If the front-passenger front airbag is enabled,
a child on the front-passenger seat may be
struck by the front-passenger airbag during
an accident.
NEVER use a rearward-facing child restraint
system on a seat with an ENABLED FRONT
AIRBAG, DEATH or SERIOUS INJURY to the
CHILD can occur.

When installing a child restraint system to the
front passenger seat, observe the vehicle-spe‐
cific information (/ page 60). Also, always
observe the notes on rearward-facing or
forward-facing child restraint systems on the
front passenger seat.
Vehicles with automatic front passenger air‐
bag shutoff:
The front passenger airbag can only be deployed
in an accident if the PASSENGER AIR BAG OFF
indicator lamp is off. If the front passenger seat
is occupied, make sure, both before and during

the journey, that the status of the front
passenger airbag is correct (/ page 45).

* NOTE Important points to remember if
the front passenger seat is unoccupied

In an accident, the components of the
restraint system may deploy unnecessarily
on the front passenger side if:
R There are heavy objects on the front

passenger seat.

R The seat belt tongue is engaged in the
seat belt buckle of the front passenger
seat and the front passenger seat is
unoccupied.

# Stow objects in a suitable place.
# Only one person should use each seat

belt at any one time.

Depending on the detected accident situation,
the window curtain airbag on the front
passenger side may deploy. The airbag is
deployed regardless of whether the front
passenger seat is occupied.

Protection by the airbags
Depending on the accident situation, an airbag
may supplement the protection offered by a cor‐
rectly fastened seat belt.

& WARNING Risk of injury or death due to

incorrect seat position

If you deviate from the correct seat position,
the airbag cannot perform its intended pro‐
tective function and deployment may even
cause further injuries.
In order to avoid risks, each vehicle occupant
must always make sure of the following:
R Fasten seat belts correctly. Pregnant
women must take particular care to
ensure that the lap belt never lies across
the abdomen.

R Adopt the correct seat position and keep
as far away as possible from the airbags.

R Observe the following information.

Occupant safety

41

# Always make sure that there are no

objects between the airbag and vehicle
occupant.

To avoid the risks resulting from the deployment
of an airbag, each vehicle occupant must
observe the following information in particular:
R Before starting your journey, adjust your seat

correctly; the driver's seat and front
passenger seat should be moved as far back
as possible.
When doing so, always observe the informa‐
tion on the correct driver's seat position
(/ page 94).

R Only hold the steering wheel by the steering
wheel rim. This allows the airbag to be fully
deployed.

R Always lean against the seat backrest when

the vehicle is in motion. Do not lean forwards
or against the door or side window. You may
otherwise be in the deployment area of the
airbags.

R Always keep your feet on the floor. Do not
put your feet on the cockpit, for example.

42 Occupant safety

Your feet may otherwise be in the deploy‐
ment area of the airbag.

R If children are traveling in the vehicle,

observe the additional notes (/ page 50).
R Always stow and secure objects correctly.
Objects in the vehicle interior may prevent an
airbag from functioning correctly. Each vehicle
occupant must always make sure of the follow‐
ing in particular:
R There are no people, animals or objects

between the vehicle occupants and an air‐
bag.

In addition, no connecting cables, tensioning
straps or retaining straps must be routed or
attached to the vehicle within the deploy‐
ment area of an airbag. Always comply with
the accessory manufacturer's installation
instructions and, in particular, the notes on
suitable places for installation.

R There are no heavy, sharp-edged or fragile

cations to the airbag cover

If you modify the cover of an airbag or affix
objects such as stickers to it, the airbag may
no longer function correctly.
# Never modify the cover of an airbag and

do not affix objects to it.

The installation location of an airbag is identified
by the AIRBAG symbol (/ page 40).

& WARNING Risk of injury or death due to

the use of unsuitable seat covers

Unsuitable seat covers can obstruct or pre‐
vent the deployment of air bags integrated
into the seats.
Consequently, the air bags cannot protect
vehicle occupants as they are designed to
do. In addition, operation of the automatic
front passenger air bag shutoff may be
restricted.
# You should only use seat covers that

have been approved for the correspond‐
ing seats by Mercedes-Benz.

& WARNING Risk of injury due to malfunc‐
tions of the sensors in the door paneling
Sensors to control the airbags are located in
the doors. Modifications or work not per‐
formed correctly to the doors or door panel‐
ing, as well as damaged doors, can lead to
the function of the sensors being impaired.
The airbags might therefore not function
properly any more.

Consequently, the airbags cannot protect
vehicle occupants as they are designed to
do.
# Never modify the doors or parts of the

doors.

# Always have work on the doors or door
paneling carried out at a qualified spe‐
cialist workshop.

& WARNING Risk of injury due to deployed

airbag

A deployed airbag no longer has a protective
function and cannot protect as intended in
the event of an accident.
# Have the vehicle towed to a qualified

specialist workshop in order to have the
deployed airbag replaced.

Have deployed airbags replaced immediately.

If the PASSENGER AIR BAG OFF indicator
lamp is lit, the front passenger airbag is disa‐
bled. It will not be deployed in the event of
an accident and cannot perform its intended
protective function.
A person in the front passenger seat could
then, for example, come into contact with
the vehicle interior, especially if the person is
sitting too close to the cockpit.
If the front passenger seat is occupied,
always ensure that:
R The classification of the person in the
front passenger seat is correct and the
front passenger airbag is enabled or disa‐
bled in accordance with the person in the
front passenger seat.

R The front passenger seat has been moved

as far back as possible.

R The person is seated correctly.
# Ensure, both before and during the jour‐

ney, that the status of the front
passenger airbag is correct.

If the front passenger seat is occupied, the clas‐
sification of the person or child restraint system
on the front passenger seat takes place after the
front passenger airbag shutoff self-test. The
PASSENGER AIR BAG indicator lamps display the
status of the front passenger airbag.
Always observe the notes on the function of the
PASSENGER AIR BAG indicator lamps
(/ page 45).

Function of the PASSENGER AIR BAG indica‐
tor lamps

Self-test of automatic front passenger airbag
shutoff
When the ignition is switched on, a self-test is
performed during which the two PASSENGER
AIR BAG ON and OFF indicator lamps light up
simultaneously.

The status of the front passenger airbag is dis‐
played after the self-test:
R PASSENGER AIR BAG ON lights up for

60 seconds, subsequently both indicator
lamps are off (PASSENGER AIR BAG ON and
OFF): the front passenger airbag is able to
deploy in the event of an accident.

R PASSENGER AIR BAG OFF lights up continu‐
ously: the front passenger airbag is disabled.
It will then not be deployed in the event of an
accident.

If the PASSENGER AIR BAG ON indicator lamp is
off, only the PASSENGER AIR BAG OFF indicator
lamp shows the status of the front passenger
airbag. The PASSENGER AIR BAG OFF indicator
lamp may be lit continuously or be off.
If the PASSENGER AIR BAG OFF indicator lamp
and the 6 restraint system warning lamp
light up simultaneously, the front passenger seat
may not be used. Also in this case, do not install
a child restraint system on the front passenger
seat. Have automatic front passenger airbag

Safely transporting children in the vehicle
Always observe when children are traveling
in the vehicle
% Also strictly observe the safety notes for the
specific situation. In this way you can recog‐
nize potential risks and avoid dangers if chil‐
dren are traveling in the vehicle
(/ page 50).

Be diligent
Bear in mind that neglecting to secure a child in
the child restraint system may have serious con‐
sequences. Always be diligent in securing a child
carefully before every journey.
To improve protection for children younger than
12 years old or under 5 ft (1.50 m) in height,
Mercedes-Benz recommends you observe the
following information:
R Always secure the child in a child restraint

system suitable for this Mercedes-Benz vehi‐
cle.

R The child restraint system must be appropri‐
ate to the age, weight and size of the child.

R The vehicle seat must be suitable for instal‐

ling a child restraint system.

Accident statistics show that children secured
on the rear seats are generally safer than chil‐
dren secured on the front seats. For this reason,
Mercedes-Benz strongly advises that you install
a child restraint system on a rear seat.
Generic term "child restraint system"
The generic term child restraint system is used
in this Operator's Manual. A child restraint sys‐
tem is, for example:
R a baby car seat
R a rearward-facing child seat
R a forward-facing child seat
R a child booster seat with a backrest and seat

belt guide
Mercedes-Benz recommends using a child
booster seat with a backrest.

The child restraint system must be appropriate
to the age, weight and size of the child.

Observing laws and legal requirements
Always observe the legal requirements when
using a child restraint system in the vehicle.
Observing standards for child restraint sys‐
tems
All child restraint systems must meet the follow‐
ing standards:
R U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards

R Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standards

213 and 225

213 and 210.2

Confirmation that the child restraint system
complies with the standards can be found on an
instruction label on the child restraint system.
This confirmation can also be found in the instal‐
lation instructions that are included with the
child restraint system.

50 Occupant safety

Detecting risks, avoiding danger
Securing systems for child restraint systems
in the vehicle
Only use the following securing systems for child
restraint systems:
R the LATCH-type (ISOFIX) mounting brackets
R the vehicle's seat belt system
R the Top Tether anchorages
Installing a LATCH-type (ISOFIX) child restraint
system is preferred.
Simply attaching to the securing rings on the
vehicle can reduce the risk of installing the child
restraint system incorrectly.
When securing a child with the integrated seat
belt of the LATCH-type (ISOFIX) child restraint
system, always comply with the permissible
gross weight for the child and child restraint sys‐
tem (/ page 56).
A booster seat may be necessary to achieve
proper seat belt positioning for children over
40 lbs (18 kg) in weight or until they reach a

height where a three-point seat belt can be
installed properly without a booster seat.
Mercedes-Benz recommends a suitable child
booster seat with a backrest and seat belt guide.
Advantage of a rearward-facing child
restraint system
It is preferable to transport a baby or a small
child in a suitable rearward-facing child restraint
system. In this case, the child sits in the oppo‐
site direction to the direction of travel and faces
backwards.
Babies and small children have comparatively
weak neck muscles in relation to the size and
weight of their head. The risk of injury to the cer‐
vical spine during an accident can be reduced in
a rearward-facing child restraint system.

Always secure a child restraint system cor‐
rectly

& WARNING Risk of injury or death caused

by incorrect installation of the child
restraint system

If the child restraint system is incorrectly
installed on a suitable seating position, it
cannot perform its intended protective func‐
tion.
The child cannot be restrained in the event of
an accident, heavy braking or a sudden
change of direction.
# Always comply with the manufacturer's

installation instructions for the child
restraint system and its correct use.
# Make sure that the entire base of the
child restraint system always rests on
the sitting surface of the seat.

# Never place objects under or behind
the child restraint system, e.g. cush‐
ions.

bench seat/rear seat and seat backrest
are not engaged

If the rear bench seat/rear seat and seat
backrest are not engaged they could fold for‐
wards, e.g. when braking suddenly or in the
event of an accident.
R If this is the case, the vehicle occupant

would be forced into the seat belt by the
rear bench seat/rear seat or by the seat
backrest. The seat belt cannot protect as

intended and could result in additional
injury.

R Objects or loads in the trunk/cargo com‐

partment cannot be restrained by the

& WARNING Risk of injury or death if the
permissible gross mass of the child and
child restraint system is exceeded

For LATCH-type (ISOFIX) child restraint sys‐
tems in which the child is secured using the
integrated seat belt in the child restraint sys‐

tem, the permissible gross mass of the child
and child restraint system is 73 lb (33 kg).
If the child and the child restraint system
together weigh more than 73 lb (33 kg), the
LATCH-type (ISOFIX) child restraint system
with integrated seat belt does not offer suffi‐
cient protection. An excessive load may be
placed on the LATCH-type (ISOFIX) child seat
attachments and the child may not be
restrained in the event of an accident, for
example.
# If the child and the child restraint sys‐

tem together weigh more than 73 lb
(33 kg), use only a LATCH-type (ISOFIX)
child restraint system that secures the
child with the vehicle seat belt.

# Also secure the child restraint system

with the Top Tether belt, if available.

Always comply with the information about the
mass of the child restraint system:
R In the manufacturer's installation and operat‐
ing instructions for the child restraint system
used

R On a label on the child restraint system, if

present

Regularly check that the permissible gross mass
of the child and child restraint system is still
complied with.
When installing a child restraint system, observe
the following:
O Always observe the correct use of the seats
and consider their suitability for attaching a
child restraint system.

O Always comply with the manufacturer's

installation and operating instructions for
the child restraint system used.

O Make sure that the child's feet do not come

into contact with the front seat. If neces‐
sary, move the front seat forward slightly.

® When installing a LATCH-type (ISOFIX)
child restraint system, also observe the follow‐
ing:
O When using a Group 0/0+ baby car seat

and a Group I rearward-facing child
restraint system on a rear seat: adjust

the front seat so that the seat does not
touch the child restraint system.

O When using a Group I forward-facing

child restraint system: the backrest of the
child restraint system must, as far as possi‐
ble, lie flat against the backrest of the vehi‐
cle seat.

O For certain child restraint systems in weight

group II or III, there may be restrictions on
the maximum size setting, e.g. due to possi‐
ble contact with the roof.

O The child restraint system must not be ten‐
sioned between the roof and the seat cush‐
ion and/or be installed facing the wrong
direction. Where possible, adjust the seat
cushion inclination accordingly.

O The child restraint system must not be put
under strain by the head restraints. Adjust

may react more sluggishly to steering move‐
ments.
If you exceed the maximum roof load, the
driving characteristics, as well as the steer‐
ing and braking characteristics, will be
greatly impaired.
# Always comply with the maximum roof

load and adjust your driving style.

You will find information on the maximum roof
load in the "Technical data" section.

tem effectiveness is not reached until the
end of this teach-in process.

R Brakepads, brake discs and tires that are

either new or have been replaced only ach‐
ieve optimum braking effect and grip after
several hundred kilometers of driving. Com‐
pensate for the reduced braking effect by
applying greater force to the brake pedal.

Notes on optimized acceleration
If all necessary prerequisites and activation con‐
ditions are fulfilled, the best possible accelera‐
tion can be achieved from a standstill.
Do not use the optimized acceleration on public
roads. Individual wheels could spin and you
could lose control of the vehicle. There is an
increased risk of skidding and/or accident.
Be sure to observe the safety notes and informa‐
tion on ESP® (/ page 186).

Pulling away with optimized acceleration

& WARNING Risk of skidding and having

an accident from wheels spinning

When you use optimized acceleration, indi‐
vidual wheels could spin and you could lose
control of the vehicle.
If ESP® is deactivated, there is a risk of skid‐
ding and accident.
# Make sure that no persons or obstacles
are in the close vicinity of your vehicle.

Requirements:
R The vehicle has been broken in

& WARNING Risk of accident and injury

due to being under the influence of alco‐
hol and drugs while driving

Driving when under the influence of alcohol
and/or drugs is an extremely dangerous
combination. Even small quantities of alcohol
or drugs may affect your reflexes, perception
and judgment.

The probability of a serious or even fatal acci‐
dent greatly increases if you drive when
under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
# Do not drink alcohol or take drugs while

driving, and do not allow anyone to
drive who has been drinking alcohol or
taking drugs.

& WARNING Risk of accident due to the

brake system overheating

ment. Otherwise, you may fail to recognize dan‐
gers.
Notes on driving on salt-treated roads
The braking effect is limited on salt-treated
roads.
Therefore, observe the following notes:
R due to salt build-up on the brake discs and

brakepads, the braking distance can increase
considerably or result in braking only on one
side

R maintain a much greater safe distance to the

vehicle in front

To remove salt build-up:
R brake occasionally while paying attention to

the traffic conditions

Driving and parking 159

R carefully depress the brake pedal at the end

of the journey and when starting the next
journey

Notes on hydroplaning
Hydroplaning can take place once a certain
amount of water has accumulated on the road
surface.
Observe the following notes during heavy precip‐
itation or in conditions in which hydroplaning
may occur:
R reduce speed
R avoid tire ruts
R avoid sudden steering movements
R brake carefully
% Also observe the notes on regularly checking

wheels and tires (/ page 458).

Notes on driving through water on the road
surface
Water which has entered into the vehicle can
damage the engine, electrics and transmission.
Water can also enter the air intake of the engine
and cause engine damage.

160 Driving and parking

Observe the following if you must drive through
water:
R observe the maximum permissible fording

depth (/ page 502)

R drive at walking pace at most, otherwise

water can enter the vehicle interior or engine
compartment

R vehicles traveling in front, or oncoming vehi‐
cles, can create waves which may exceed the
maximum permissible height of the water

The braking effect of the brakes is reduced after
fording. Brake carefully while paying attention to
the traffic conditions until braking power has
been fully restored.

Notes on off-road driving

& WARNING Risk of accident if you do not

keep to line of fall on inclines

If you drive at an angle or turn on an incline,
the vehicle could slip sideways, tip and roll‐
over.

# Always drive on inclines in the line of
fall (straight up or down) and do not
turn.

& WARNING Risk of fire due to flammable

materials on hot parts of the exhaust
system

Flammable material such as leaves, grass or
twigs may ignite if they come into contact
with hot parts of the exhaust system.
# When driving on unpaved roads or off-
road, regularly check the vehicle under‐
side.

# Remove trapped plants or other flam‐

mable material.

# If there is damage, consult a qualified

specialist workshop immediately.

When driving off-road, substances such as sand,
mud and water or water mixed with oil may get
into the brakes. This may lead to a reduction in
braking effect or total brake failure as a result of
increased wear. The braking characteristics will
vary depending on the material that has entered

the system. Clean the brakes after driving off-
road. If you then notice reduced braking effect
or hear scraping noises, have the brake system
checked at a qualified specialist workshop.
Adjust your driving style to the changed braking
characteristics.

Function of 4MATIC
4MATIC ensures that all four wheels are driven
when needed. Together with ESP® and 4ETS,
4MATIC improves the traction of your vehicle
whenever a driven wheel spins due to insuffi‐
cient traction.
If you fail to adapt your driving style, 4MATIC can
neither reduce the risk of an accident nor over‐
ride the laws of physics. 4MATIC cannot take
account of road, weather and traffic conditions.
4MATIC is only an aid. You are responsible espe‐
cially for maintaining a safe distance from the
vehicle in front, for vehicle speed, for braking in
good time and for staying in lane.
% In wintry road conditions, the maximum

effect of 4MATIC can be achieved only if you
use winter tires (M+S tires), with snow
chains if necessary.

Driving and driving safety systems
Driving systems and your responsibility
Your vehicle is equipped with driving systems
which assist you in driving, parking and maneu‐
vering the vehicle. The driving systems are aids
and do not relieve you of your responsibility per‐
taining to road traffic law. Pay attention to the
traffic conditions at all times and intervene
when necessary. Be aware of the limitations
regarding the safe use of these systems.

Information on radar and ultrasonic sensors
Some driving and driving safety systems use
radar or ultrasonic sensors to monitor the area
in front of, behind or next to the vehicle (depend‐
ing on the vehicle's equipment).
Depending on the vehicle's equipment, the radar
sensors are integrated behind the bumpers
and/or behind the Mercedes star. The ultrasonic
sensors are located in the front and rear bump‐
ers. Keep these parts free of dirt, ice and slush
(/ page 433). The sensors must not be cov‐
ered, for example by bicycle racks, overhanging
loads, stickers, foil or foils to protect against
stone chipping. Additional license plate brackets
can likewise impair the function of the ultrasonic
sensors. In the event of damage to the bumpers
or radiator grill, or following a collision impacting
the bumpers or radiator grill, have the function
of the sensors checked at a qualified specialist
workshop. If the sensors are damaged, some
driving systems and driving safety systems may
no longer function properly.

Function of ABS
The Anti-lock Brake System (ABS) regulates the
brake pressure in critical driving situations:
R During braking, e.g. at full brake application

or insufficient tire traction, the wheels are
prevented from locking.

R Vehicle steerability while braking is ensured.
If ABS intervenes when braking, you will feel a
pulsing in the brake pedal. The pulsating brake
pedal can be an indication of hazardous road
conditions and can serve as a reminder to take
extra care while driving.
System limits
R ABS is active from speeds of approx. 5 mph

(8 km/h).

R ABS may be impaired or may not function if a

malfunction has occurred and the yel‐
low ! ABS warning lamp lights up contin‐
uously in the instrument cluster after the
engine is started.

Driving and parking 185

Functions of Off-road ABS
% Off-road ABS is activated automatically when

you select the F or G drive program.
Off-road ABS is specially adapted for driving off-
road:
R The front wheels lock cyclically during brak‐

ing.

R The braking distance is shortened due to the

digging-in effect.

System limits
R Off-road ABS functions at speeds below

25 mph (40 km/h).

R If Off-road ABS intervenes, the ability to steer

may be restricted.

186 Driving and parking

Function of BAS (Brake Assist System)

& WARNING Risk of an accident caused by

a malfunction in BAS (Brake Assist Sys‐
tem)

If BAS is malfunctioning, the braking distance
in an emergency braking situation is
increased.
# Depress the brake pedal with full force
in emergency braking situations. ABS
prevents the wheels from locking.

BAS supports your emergency braking situation
with additional brake force.
If you depress the brake pedal quickly, BAS is
activated:
R BAS automatically boosts the brake pres‐

sure.

R BAS can shorten the braking distance.
R ABS prevents the wheels from locking.
The brakes will function as usual once you
release the brake pedal. BAS is deactivated.

Functions of ESP® (Electronic Stability Pro‐
gram)

Function of ESP® Crosswind Assist

ESP® Crosswind Assist detects sudden gusts of
side wind and helps the driver to keep the vehi‐
cle in the lane:
R ESP® Crosswind Assist is active at vehicle

speeds between approx. 50 mph (80 km/h)
and 125 mph (200 km/h) when driving
straight ahead or cornering slightly.

R The vehicle is stabilized by means of individ‐

ual brake application on one side.

Function of ESP® trailer stabilization

& WARNING Risk of accident in poor road

and weather conditions

In poor road and weather conditions, the
trailer stabilization cannot prevent lurching of
the vehicle/trailer combination. Trailers with
a high center of gravity may tip over before
ESP® detects this.
# Always adapt your driving style to suit

the current road and weather condi‐
tions.

When driving with a trailer, ESP® can stabilize
your vehicle if the trailer begins to swerve from
side to side:
R ESP® trailer stabilization is active above

speeds of 40 mph (65 km/h).

R Slight swerving is reduced by means of a tar‐

geted, individual brake application on one
side.

R In the event of severe swerving, the engine

output is also reduced and all wheels are
braked.

ESP® trailer stabilization may be impaired or
may not function if:
R The trailer is not connected correctly or is

not detected properly by the vehicle.

Function of EBD (electronic brake force dis‐
tribution)
EBD is characterized by the following:
R Monitoring and regulating the brake pressure

on the rear wheels.

R Improved driving stability when braking,

especially on bends.

Function of STEER CONTROL
STEER CONTROL helps you by transmitting a
noticeable steering force to the steering wheel in
the direction required for vehicle stabilization.

Function of Active Brake Assist
Active Brake Assist consists of the following
functions:
R Distance warning function
R Autonomous braking function

192 Driving and parking

R Situation-dependent braking assistance
R Vehicles with Driving Assistance Pack‐
age: Evasive Steering Assist and cornering
function

Active Brake Assist can help you to minimize the
risk of a collision with vehicles, cyclists or
pedestrians, or reduce the effects of such a colli‐
sion.
If Active Brake Assist has detected a risk of colli‐
sion, a warning tone sounds and the L dis‐
tance warning lamp lights up in the instrument
cluster.
If you do not react to the warning, autonomous
braking can be initiated in critical situations.
In especially critical situations, Active Brake
Assist can initiate autonomous braking directly.
In this case, the warning lamp and warning tone
occur simultaneously with the braking applica‐
tion.
If you apply the brake yourself in a critical situa‐
tion or apply the brake during autonomous brak‐
ing, situation-dependent braking assistance

occurs. The brake pressure increases up to max‐
imum full-stop braking if necessary.

If autonomous braking or situation-dependent
braking assistance has occurred, display 1
appears in the multifunction display and then
automatically goes out after a short time.
If the autonomous braking function or the situa‐
tion-dependent braking assistance is triggered,
additional preventive measures for occupant
protection (PRE-SAFE®) may also be initiated.

& WARNING Risk of an accident caused by

limited detection performance of Active
Brake Assist

Active Brake Assist cannot always clearly
identify objects and complex traffic situa‐
tions.
In such cases, Active Brake Assist might:
R Give a warning or brake without reason
R Not give a warning or not brake
# Always pay careful attention to the traf‐
fic situation; do not rely on Active Brake
Assist alone. Active Brake Assist is only
an aid. The driver is responsible for
maintaining a suitable distance to the
vehicle in front, vehicle speed and for
braking in good time.

# Be prepared to brake or swerve if nec‐

essary.

% If the system is unavailable, the æ display

appears in the multifunction display.

Also observe the system limits of Active Brake
Assist.

The individual subfunctions are available in
the following speed ranges:
The distance warning function issues a warning

foot from the accelerator pedal after overtaking,
cruise control will resume speed regulation back
to the stored speed.
Cruise control is operated using the correspond‐
ing steering wheel buttons. You can store any
speed above 15 mph (20 km/h) up to the maxi‐
mum speed.
If you fail to adapt your driving style, cruise con‐
trol can neither reduce the risk of an accident
nor override the laws of physics. It cannot take
into account road, weather or traffic conditions.
Cruise control is only an aid. The driver is
responsible for the distance to the vehicle in
front, for vehicle speed, for braking in good time
and for staying in lane.
Mercedes‑AMG vehicles: Cruise control is
available up to a maximum speed of 155 mph
(250 km/h).

% The segments between the stored speed and

the end of the segment display light up in
the speedometer.

System limits
Cruise control may be unable to maintain the
stored speed on uphill gradients. The stored
speed is resumed when the gradient evens out.
Change into a lower gear in good time on long
and steep downhill gradients. Take particular
note of this when driving a laden vehicle. By

doing so, you will make use of the engine's brak‐
ing effect. This relieves the load on the brake
system and prevents the brakes from overheat‐
ing and wearing too quickly.
Do not use cruise control in the following situa‐
tions:
R In traffic situations which require frequent
changes of speed, e.g. in heavy traffic, on
winding roads.

R On slippery roads. Accelerating can cause

the drive wheels to lose traction and the
vehicle could then skid.

R If you are driving when visibility is poor.

DSR (Downhill Speed Regulation)
Function of DSR (Downhill Speed Regulation)
DSR is an aid to assist you when driving down‐
hill. It keeps the speed of travel at the selected

Driving and parking 199

target speed. The steeper the downhill gradient,
the greater the DSR braking effect on the vehi‐
cle. On flat stretches of road and uphill gradi‐
ents, the DSR brakes the vehicle minimally or
not at all.
When DSR is activated and the transmission is in
position h, k or i, DSR controls the driving
speed. The target speed can be set to a value
between 1 mph (2 km/h) and 11 mph
(18 km/h). By braking or accelerating, you can
drive at a higher or lower speed than the target
speed at any time.
DSR is deactivated automatically if you drive at
speeds greater than 28 mph (45 km/h) or select
drive program C or B. The î Off mes‐
sage then appears in the multifunction display.
The status indicator in the multifunction display
disappears. You also hear a warning tone.

Notes on DSR

& WARNING Risk of skidding and having
an accident when DSR is activated on
slippery road surfaces

If the speed driven and the target speed dif‐
fer, and you activate DSR on a slippery road
surface, the wheels may lose traction.
# Take into account the road surface and

the difference between the driving
speed and target speed before activat‐
ing DSR.

If you fail to adapt your driving style, DSR can
neither reduce the risk of an accident nor over‐
ride the laws of physics. It cannot take into
account road, weather or traffic conditions. DSR
is only an aid. You are responsible for maintain‐
ing a safe distance to the vehicle in front, for
vehicle speed, for braking in good time and for
staying in lane.
You are always responsible for keeping control of
the vehicle and for assessing whether the down‐
hill gradient can be managed. Depending on
road surface and tires, DSR may not always be

able to keep to the target speed. Select a target
speed suitable for the environmental conditions
and also apply the brakes yourself if required.
Activating/deactivating DSR (Downhill Speed
Regulation)
Requirements:
R You are driving at 24 mph (40 km/h) or

slower.
If the current vehicle speed is too high, the

Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC
Function of Active Distance Assist
DISTRONIC

Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC maintains the
set speed on free-flowing roads. If vehicles in
front are detected, the set distance is main‐
tained, if necessary, until the vehicle comes to a
halt. The vehicle accelerates or brakes depend‐
ing on the distance to the vehicle in front and

the set speed. The speed and distance to the
vehicle in front are set and saved on the steering
wheel on vehicles without the Driving Assistance
Package, in the range between 15 mph
(20 km/h) and 120 mph (200 km/h) and, on
vehicles with the Driving Assistance Package, in
the range between 15 mph (20 km/h) and
130 mph (210 km/h).
The adjustable set speed can vary due to the fol‐
lowing factors:
R Plug-in hybrid: drive program selected,
observe the relevant notes in the Supple‐
ment.

R Maximum speed, e.g. winter tire limit
Other features of Active Distance Assist
DISTRONIC:
R Adjusts the driving style depending on the
selected drive program (fuel efficient, com‐
fortable or dynamic) (/ page 165)

R Vehicles with Driving Assistance Pack‐

age: reacts to stationary vehicles detected in
urban speed ranges (except bicycles and
motorcycles).

Driving and parking 201

R Initiates acceleration to the stored speed if

the turn signal indicator is switched on to
change to the overtaking lane.

R Vehicles with Driving Assistance Pack‐

age: takes one-sided overtaking restrictions
into account on highways or on multi-lane
roads with separate roadways (country-
dependent).

Vehicles with Active Parking Assist and Driv‐
ing Assistance Package: if the vehicle has
been braked to a standstill on multi-lane, sepa‐
rate roadways by Active Distance Assist
DISTRONIC, it can automatically follow the vehi‐
cle in front driving off again within 30 seconds. If
a critical situation is detected when driving off, a
visual and acoustic warning is given indicating
that the driver must now take control of the vehi‐
cle. The vehicle is not accelerated any further.
Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC is only an aid.
The driver is responsible for keeping a safe dis‐
tance to the vehicle in front, for vehicle speed
and for braking in good time.

If a change in the speed limit is detected and
automatic adoption of speed limits is activated,
the new speed is automatically adopted as the
stored speed (/ page 241).
The driven speed is adjusted when the vehicle is
level with the traffic sign at the latest. In the
case of signs indicating entry into an urban area,
the speed is adapted according to the speed
permitted within the urban area. The speed limit
display in the Instrument Display is always upda‐
ted when the vehicle is level with the traffic sign.
If there is no speed restriction on an unlimited
stretch of road (e.g. on a freeway), the recom‐
mended speed is automatically adopted as the
stored speed. The system uses the speed stored
on an unlimited stretch of road as the recom‐
mended speed. If you do not alter the stored
speed on an unlimited stretch of road, the rec‐
ommended speed is 80 mph (130 km/h).
If Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC has been
put into passive mode by pressing the accelera‐
tor pedal, only speed limits which are higher
than the set speed are adopted.

Active Speed Limit Assist is only an aid. The
driver is responsible for keeping a safe distance
from the vehicle in front, for vehicle speed and
for braking in good time. The maximum permissi‐
ble speed also depends on factors such as the
road surface and traffic conditions.
System limits
Temporary speed restrictions (e.g. for a certain
time or due to weather conditions) cannot be
properly detected by the system. The maximum
permissible speed applying to a vehicle with a
trailer is not detected by the system. In these sit‐
uations you must adjust your speed yourself.

& WARNING Risk of accident due to Active

The speed adopted by Active Speed Limit
Assist may be too high or incorrect in some
individual cases, such as:
R In the wet or in fog
R When towing a trailer

# Ensure that the driven speed complies

with traffic regulations.

# Adjust the driving speed to suit current

traffic and weather conditions.

Function of route-based speed adaptation
% The following function is country-dependent

and only available in conjunction with the
Driving Assistance Package.

When Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC is acti‐
vated, the vehicle speed will be adjusted accord‐
ingly to the route events ahead. Depending on
the drive program selected, the vehicle negoti‐
ates a route event ahead in a fuel-saving, com‐
fortable or dynamic manner. When the route
event has been passed, the vehicle accelerates
again to the stored speed. The set distance to
the vehicle in front, vehicles detected ahead and
speed restrictions ahead are taken into account.
Route-based speed adaptation can be config‐
ured in the multimedia system (/ page 206).

206 Driving and parking

The following route events are taken into
account:
R Bends
R T-intersections, traffic circles and toll sta‐

tions

R Turns and exits
R Traffic jams ahead (only with Live Traffic

(/ page 351))

% When the toll station is reached, Active Dis‐

tance Assist DISTRONIC adopts the speed as
the stored speed.

Also, the speed is reduced if the turn signal indi‐
cator to change lanes is switched on and one of
the following situations is detected:
R Turning off at intersections
R Driving on slowing-down lanes
R Driving on lanes adjacent to slowing-down

lanes

The driver is responsible for choosing the right
speed and observing other road users. This
applies in particular to intersections, traffic cir‐
cles and traffic lights, as route-based speed

adaptation does not brake the vehicle to a stand‐
still.
When route guidance is active, the first speed
adjustment is carried out automatically. If the
turn signal indicator is switched on, the selected
route is confirmed and further speed adjustment
is activated.
Speed adjustment is canceled in the following
cases:
R If the turn signal indicator is switched off

before the route event.

R If the driver depresses the accelerator or

brake pedal during the process.

System limits
Route-based speed adaptation does not take
right of way regulations into account. The driver
is responsible for complying with road traffic
regulations and driving at a suitable speed.
In difficult conditions, for example unclear roads,
lane narrowing, wet road surfaces, snow or ice,
or when driving with a trailer, the speed adjust‐
ment made by the system may not always be
suitable. In these situations the driver must
intervene accordingly.

& WARNING Risk of accident in spite of

route-based speed adjustment

Route-based speed adjustment might mal‐
function or be temporarily unavailable in the
following situations:
R If map data is not up to date or available
R If you do not follow the selected route

guidance

R If the set route is re-planned
R In road construction areas
R When towing a trailer
R In bad weather or road conditions
R If the accelerator pedal is depressed

Active Steering Assist
Function of Active Steering Assist
% The following function is country-dependent

and only available in conjunction with the
Driving Assistance Package.

Active Steering Assist is only available up to a
speed of 130 mph (210 km/h). The system helps
you to stay in the center of the lane by means of
moderate steering interventions. Depending on
the speed driven, Active Steering Assist uses the
vehicles ahead and lane markings as a refer‐
ence.

% Depending on the country, in the lower

speed range Active Steering Assist can use
the surrounding traffic as a reference. If nec‐
essary, Active Steering Assist can then also
provide assistance when driving outside the
center of the lane to form a rescue lane, for
example.

When the system is actively steering, the à
symbol is shown in green in the multifunction
display.
If the detection of lane markings and vehicles
ahead is impaired, Active Steering Assist
switches to passive mode. The system provides
no support in this case. During the transition
from active to passive status, the à symbol is
shown as enlarged and flashing. Once the sys‐
tem is passive, the à symbol is shown as
gray in the multifunction display.
Steering and touch detection
The driver is required to keep their hands on the
steering wheel at all times and be able to inter‐
vene at any time to correct the course of the
vehicle and keep it in lane. The driver must

Driving and parking 207

expect a change from active to passive mode or
vice versa at any time.

If the system detects that the driver has not
steered the vehicle for a considerable period of
time or has removed their hands from the steer‐
ing wheel, an optical warning is given first. Dis‐
play 1 appears in the multifunction display. If
the driver still does not steer the vehicle, or
gives no confirmation to the system, a warning
tone sounds in addition to the visual warning
message.
The warning is not issued, or is stopped, when
the driver gives confirmation to the system:
R The driver steers the vehicle.

208 Driving and parking

R The driver presses a steering wheel button or

operates Touch Control.

If Active Steering Assist detects that a system
limit has been reached, a visual warning is
issued and a warning tone sounds.
Active Steering Assist is only an aid. The driver is
responsible for the distance to the vehicle in
front, for vehicle speed, for braking in good time
and for staying in lane. Before changing lanes,
the driver must make sure that the neighboring
lane is free (glance over the shoulder).
System limits
Active Steering Assist has a limited steering tor‐
que for lateral guidance. In some cases, the
steering intervention is not sufficient to keep the
vehicle in the lane or to drive through exits.
The system may be impaired or may not function
in the following instances:
R There is poor visibility, e.g. due to snow, rain,

fog, heavy spray, greatly varying ambient
light or strong shadows on the roadway.

R There is glare, e.g. from oncoming traffic,

direct sunlight or reflections.

R Insufficient road illumination.
R The windshield is dirty, fogged up, damaged
or covered in the vicinity of the camera, e.g.
by a sticker.

R No, or several, unclear lane markings are

present for one lane, or the markings change
quickly, e.g. in a construction area or inter‐
sections.

R The lane markings are worn away, dark or

covered up, e.g. by dirt or snow.

R The distance to the vehicle in front is too

small and the lane markings thus cannot be
detected.

R The road is narrow and winding.
R There are obstacles on the lane or projecting

out into the lane, such as object markers.
The system does not provide assistance in the
following conditions:
R On tight bends and when turning.
R When crossing intersections.
R At traffic circles or toll stations.
R When towing a trailer.

R When actively changing lane without switch‐

ing on the turn signal indicator.

R When the tire pressure is too low.
Depending on the selected vehicle settings,
Active Steering Assist may be unavailable.
Observe the status display of Active Steering
Assist in the multifunction display
(/ page 211).

& WARNING Risk of accident if Active

Steering Assist unexpectedly stops func‐
tioning

If the system limits of Active Steering Assist
are reached there is no guarantee that the
system will remain active or will keep the
vehicle in lane.
# Always keep your hands on the steering
wheel and observe the traffic carefully.
# Always steer the vehicle paying atten‐

tion to traffic conditions.

Active Lane Change Assist supports the driver
when changing lanes by applying steering torque
if the driver operates a turn signal indicator.

& WARNING Risk of an accident due to the
HOLD function being activated when you
leave the vehicle

If you leave the vehicle while only the HOLD
function is braking the vehicle, the vehicle
can roll away in the following situations:
R If there is a malfunction in the system or

in the power supply.

R If the HOLD function is deactivated by

depressing the accelerator pedal or brake
pedal, e.g. by a vehicle occupant.

# Always deactivate the HOLD function

Function of Hill Start Assist
Hill Start Assist holds the vehicle for a short
time when pulling away on a hill under the fol‐
lowing conditions:
R The transmission is in position h or k.
R The electric parking brake is released.
This gives you enough time to move your foot
from the brake pedal to the accelerator pedal
and depress it before the vehicle begins to roll
away.

& WARNING Risk of accident and injury

due to the vehicle rolling away

After a short time, Hill Start Assist no longer
holds the vehicle and it can roll away.
# Therefore, swiftly move your foot from

the brake pedal to the accelerator
pedal. Never attempt to leave the vehi‐
cle if it is being held by Hill Start Assist.

Function of the passive side impact protec‐
tion
Passive side impact protection is an additional
Parking Assist PARKTRONIC function which
warns the driver about obstacles at the side of
the vehicle. A warning is issued when obstacles
are detected between the front and rear detec‐
tion range. In order for an object on the side to
be detected, the sensors in the front and rear

bumper must first detect the object while you
are driving past it.
During the parking procedure or maneuvering,
objects are detected as the vehicle drives past.
If you steer in the direction of a detected obsta‐
cle and there is a risk of a lateral collision, a
warning is issued. The segments on the sides
light up yellow or red, depending on the distance
to the obstacle.

Active Parking Assist
Function of Active Parking Assist
Active Parking Assist is an electronic parking
assistance system which uses ultrasound and is
automatically activated during forward travel.
The system is operational at speeds below
approximately 22 mph (35 km/h).
If all requirements are met, the Ç display
appears in the multifunction display. The system

then independently locates and measures paral‐
lel and perpendicular parking spaces on both
sides of the vehicle.
When Active Parking Assist has detected parking
spaces, the È display appears in the multi‐
function display. The arrows show on which side
of the road detected parking spaces are located.
They are then shown in the media display. The
parking space and, if necessary, the parking
direction can be selected as desired. Active
Parking Assist calculates a suitable vehicle path,
switches on the turn signal indicator and assists
you in parking and exiting the parking space.
Active Parking Assist provides assistance when
changing gear, accelerating, braking and steer‐
ing the vehicle.
Active Parking Assist is only an aid. It is not a
substitute for your attention to the surroundings.
The responsibility for safe maneuvering and
parking remains with you. Make sure that no
persons, animals or objects etc. are in the
maneuvering range.

Active Parking Assist is canceled if, among other
things, one of the following actions is carried
out:
R Parking Assist PARKTRONIC is deactivated.
R Active Parking Assist is deactivated.
R You begin steering.
R You apply the parking brake.
R You engage transmission position j.
R ESP® intervenes.
R You open the doors or the tailgate while driv‐

ing.

System limits
Objects located above or below the detection
range of Parking Assist PARKTRONIC or Active
Parking Assist are not detected when the park‐
ing space is being measured. These are also not
taken into account when the parking maneuver
is calculated, e.g. overhanging loads, overhangs
or loading ramps of trucks or the boundaries of
parking spaces. In some circumstances, Active
Parking Assist may therefore guide you into the
parking space prematurely.

& WARNING Risk of accident due to
objects located above or below the
detection range of Active Parking Assist

If there are objects above or below the
detection range, the following situations may
arise:
R Active Parking Assist may steer too early.
R Vehicles with automatic transmis‐

sion: The vehicle may not stop in front of
these objects.

This could cause a collision.
# In these situations, do not use Active

Parking Assist.

Snowfall or heavy rain may lead to a parking
space being measured inaccurately. Parking
spaces that are partially occupied by trailer
drawbars might not be identified as such or be
measured incorrectly. Only use Active Parking
Assist on level, high-grip ground.

Driving and parking 233

Do not use Active Parking Assist in the following
situations:
R In extreme weather conditions such as ice,

packed snow or in heavy rain.

R When transporting a load that protrudes

beyond the vehicle.

R If the parking space is on a steep downhill or

uphill gradient.

R When snow chains are installed.
Active Parking Assist may also display parking
spaces that are not suitable for parking, e.g. the
following:
R Parking spaces where parking is prohibited.
R Parking spaces on unsuitable surfaces.
Active Parking Assist will not assist you with
parking spaces at right angles to the direction of
travel in the following situations:
R If two parking spaces are located immedi‐

ately next to each other.

R If the parking space is immediately next to a

low obstacle such as a curb.

234 Driving and parking

Active Parking Assist will not assist you with
parking spaces parallel or at right angles to the
direction of travel in the following situations:
R If the parking space is on a curb.
R If the parking space is bordered by an obsta‐

cle, e.g. a tree, a post or a trailer.

ATTENTION ASSIST
Function of ATTENTION ASSIST
ATTENTION ASSIST assists you on long, monoto‐
nous journeys, e.g. on highways and trunk roads.
If ATTENTION ASSIST detects indicators of fati‐
gue or increasing lapses in concentration on the
part of the driver, it suggests taking a break.
ATTENTION ASSIST is only an aid. It cannot
always detect fatigue or lapses in concentration
in time. The system is not a substitute for a well-
rested and attentive driver. On long journeys,
take regular breaks in good time that allow for
adequate recuperation.
You can choose between two settings:
R Standard: normal system sensitivity.
R Sensitive: higher system sensitivity. The
driver is warned earlier and the attention
level detected by ATTENTION ASSIST is adap‐
ted accordingly.

If drowsiness or increasing lapses in concentra‐
tion are detected, the ATTENTION ASSIST: Take
a Break! warning appears in the Instrument Dis‐
play. You can acknowledge the message and

take a break where necessary. If you do not take
a break and ATTENTION ASSIST continues to
detect increasing lapses in concentration, you
will be warned again after a minimum of

Traffic Sign Assist
Function of Traffic Sign Assist

Traffic Sign Assist detects traffic signs with mul‐
tifunction camera 1. It assists you by display‐
ing detected speed limits and overtaking restric‐
tions in the instrument cluster and optionally in
the head-up display or central display.
Since Traffic Sign Assist also uses the data
stored in the navigation system, it can update
the display in the following situations without
detecting traffic signs:
R When the vehicle changes roads, e.g. on a

highway entry or exit road.

R When a village or city boundary which is

stored in the digital map is passed.

The camera also detects traffic signs with a
restriction indicated by an additional sign (e.g. in
wet conditions).
Traffic Sign Assist is only an aid. The driver is
responsible for keeping a safe distance from the
vehicle in front, for vehicle speed and for braking
in good time.
Warning when the maximum permissible
speed is exceeded
The system can warn you if you unintentionally
exceed the maximum permissible speed. To do
this, you can specify in the multimedia system
by how much the maximum permissible speed
can be exceeded before a warning is issued. You
can specify whether the warning is to be just a
visual warning or an acoustic one as well.

monitor the area up to 130 ft (40 m) behind and
10 ft (3 m) next to your vehicle.
If a vehicle is detected at speeds above approx‐
imately 8 mph (12 km/h) and this vehicle subse‐
quently enters the monitoring range directly next
to your vehicle, the warning lamp in the outside
mirror lights up red.

If a vehicle is detected close to the side of your
vehicle, the red warning lamp in the outside mir‐
ror flashes. If you switch on the turn signal indi‐
cator in the corresponding direction, a warning
tone sounds once. If the turn signal indicator
remains switched on, all other detected vehicles
are indicated only by the flashing of the red
warning lamp.
If you overtake a vehicle quickly, no warning is
given.

& WARNING Risk of accident despite Blind

Spot Assist

Blind Spot Assist does not react to vehicles
approaching and overtaking you at a greatly
different speed.
As a result, Blind Spot Assist cannot warn
drivers in this situation.

If you operate information and communica‐
tion equipment integrated in the vehicle
when driving, you will be distracted from the
traffic situation. This could also cause you to
lose control of the vehicle.
# Only operate this equipment when the

traffic situation permits.

# If you cannot be sure of this, stop the
vehicle whilst paying attention to road
and traffic conditions and operate the
equipment with the vehicle stationary.

& WARNING Risk of an accident from

operating mobile communication equip‐
ment while the vehicle is in motion

Mobile communications devices distract the
driver from the traffic situation. This could

also cause the driver to lose control of the
vehicle.
# As the driver, only operate mobile com‐
munications devices when the vehicle is
stationary.

# As a vehicle occupant, only use mobile

communications devices in the areas
intended for this purpose, e.g. in the

being stowed incorrectly

If objects in the vehicle interior are stowed
incorrectly, they can slide or be thrown
around and hit vehicle occupants. In addi‐
tion, cup holders, open stowage spaces and
mobile phone receptacles cannot always
retain all objects they contain.
There is a risk of injury, particularly in the
event of sudden braking or a sudden change
in direction.

Notes on optimal use of the Voice Control
System
Notes on how to improve recognition:
R Activate online voice control (/ page 267).
R Only operate the Voice Control System from

the driver's seat.

R Say the voice commands coherently and
clearly, but do not exaggerate the words.
R Avoid loud noises that cause interference
while making a voice command entry, e.g.
the entertainment in the rear passenger
compartment.

R For telephone or address book entries:

- Only create sensible address book entries

in the system/mobile phone, e.g. enter
surname and first name in the correct
field.

- Do not use any abbreviations, unneces‐

sary spaces or special characters.

R For radio station names: say the Read out

station list voice command and say the
desired station name in the way the voice
output reads aloud to you.

% To improve recognition, depending on the

outside temperature, either the blowers for
ventilation or heating are reduced when the
Voice Control System is started.

Notes on online voice control
Online voice control improves recognition and
makes additional results available as a result of
external information, e.g. information about POIs
and about the weather. We therefore recom‐
mend that you activate online voice control.
You will need a Mercedes me user account for
this. If you do not yet have a user account you
have to create one and connect it with your vehi‐
cle (/ page 298).
Then call up your Mercedes me user account.
The Mercedes me services are shown and can
be activated (/ page 299).
In addition, online voice control must be activa‐
ted (/ page 267).

Notes on route guidance

& WARNING Risk of distraction from oper‐

ating integrated communication equip‐
ment while the vehicle is in motion

If you operate communication equipment
integrated in the vehicle when driving, you
will be distracted from the traffic situation.
This could also cause you to lose control of
the vehicle.
# Only operate this equipment when the

traffic situation permits.

# If you cannot be sure of this, stop the
vehicle whilst paying attention to road
and traffic conditions and operate the
equipment with the vehicle stationary.

You must observe the legal requirements for the
country in which you are currently driving when
operating the multimedia system.
Route guidance begins once a route has been
calculated.

The road and traffic rules and regulations always
have priority over multimedia system driving
instructions.
Driving instructions are:
R Navigation announcements
R Route guidance displays
R Lane recommendations
If you do not follow the driving instructions or if
you leave the calculated route, a new route is
calculated automatically.
Driving instructions may differ from the actual
road and traffic conditions if:
R The route is diverted
R The direction of a one-way street has been

changed

For this reason, you must always observe road
and traffic rules and regulations during your
journey as well as the prevailing traffic condi‐
tions.
The route may differ from the ideal route due to
the following:
R Roadworks

R Incomplete digital map data
Notes on GPS reception
The correct function of the navigation system
depends amongst other things on GPS recep‐
tion. In certain situations GPS reception can be
impaired, defective or even not possible, e.g. in
tunnels or in parking garages.
Changing direction overview
Changes of direction are shown in the following
displays:
R Detailed image of the intersection

The display appears when you drive into an
intersection.

R 3D image

The display appears when driving on inter‐
section-free, multi-lane roads, for example on
freeway exits and freeway interchanges.

MBUX multimedia system 345

Example: 3D image of the upcoming change
of direction

1 Driving maneuver
2 Maneuver point, above this the current dis‐

tance to the change of direction

3 Current vehicle position
There are three phases when changing direction:
R Preparation phase

If there is enough time between the changes
of direction, the multimedia system prepares
you for the upcoming change of direction. A
navigation announcement is issued depend‐

346 MBUX multimedia system

ing on the settings for driving recommenda‐
tions, e.g. "Prepare to turn right".
Select navigation announcements for driving
recommendations (/ page 339).
The map appears in full-screen mode.
The status line shows: the direction informa‐
tion or the name of the road which is to be
turned into and the distance to the change of
direction.

R Announcement phase

The multimedia system announces the
upcoming change of direction depending on
the settings for driving recommendations,
e.g. by announcing "In 600 ft (200 m) at the
end of the street turn right into Station
Road".
The display is split into two parts. The map is
displayed on the left; on the right, there is a
detailed image of the intersection or a 3D
image of the upcoming change of direction.

R Change-of-direction phase

The multimedia system announces the immi‐
nent change of direction depending on the

settings for driving recommendations, e.g. by
announcing "Now turn right".
The display is split into two parts.
The change of direction takes place when the
distance to maneuver point 2 is shown with
0 ft (0 m) and the symbol for vehicle position
3 has reached maneuver point 2.
When the change of direction is complete,
the map appears in full-screen mode.

% Changes of direction are also shown in the

Instrument Display.

Lane recommendations overview
This display appears for multi-lane roads.
The multimedia system can show lane recom‐
mendations if the digital map contains the rele‐
vant data.

1 Lane not recommended (gray arrow)
2 Possible lane (white arrow)
3 Recommended lane (white arrow, blue back‐

ground)

Explanation of the displayed lanes:
R Lane not recommended 1

In this lane, you will not be able to complete
the next change of direction without chang‐
ing lane.

R Possible lane 2

In this lane, you will only be able to complete
the next change of direction.

R Recommended lane 3

In this lane, you will be able to complete both
the next change of direction and the one
after that.

During the change of direction, new lanes may
be added.
Bus lanes are also shown.
% Lane recommendations can also be dis‐

played in the Instrument Display and in the
Head-up Display.

Information and are used for route guidance.
This service is unavailable in some countries.
There may be differences between the traffic
reports received and the actual road and traffic
conditions.
Important information on Live Traffic Informa‐
tion:
R Current traffic reports are received via the

Internet connection.

R The traffic situation is updated at short, regu‐

lar intervals.

R The subscription information shows the sta‐

Information on the vehicle's position is regularly
sent to Daimler AG. The data is immediately ren‐
dered anonymous by Daimler AG and forwarded
to the traffic data provider. Using this data, traf‐
fic reports relevant to the vehicle's position are
sent to the vehicle. The vehicle acts as a sensor
for the flow of traffic and helps to improve the
quality of the traffic reports.
If you do not wish to transmit your vehicle posi‐

Car-to-X-Communication
Car-to-X-Communication overview
The following requirements apply for using Car-
to-X-Communication:
R The vehicle is equipped with a multimedia

system featuring navigation and a communi‐
cation module with an activated, integrated
SIM card.

R Car-to-X-Communication is activated.
% Car-to-X-Communication is available in

selected countries.

The communication module automatically estab‐
lishes an Internet connection once the ignition is
switched on. If there are any hazard warnings,
they will be provided shortly thereafter. Depend‐
ing on the mobile phone connection, the provi‐
sion takes place from within a second up to
about a minute.
Benefits of Car-to-X-Communication:
R Hazards are recognized automatically in the
background by the vehicle or may be repor‐
ted by the driver. These are then sent to vehi‐

cles with Car-to-X-Communication in the
immediate vicinity.

R If available, current details relating to hazard
spots near the vehicle's current position are
received.
This gives you sufficient time to adapt your
driving style to the traffic conditions.

The use of Car-to-X-Communication requires the
regular transmission of vehicle data to Daimler
AG. The data is then immediately pseudony‐
mized by Daimler AG. The vehicle data is deleted
after an appropriate amount of time has elapsed
(several weeks) and is not stored permanently.
% Data which serves as identification is

replaced during the pseudonymization proc‐
ess. In this way, your identity is protected
against access by unauthorized third parties.

The following system information is transmitted:
R Software release of the multimedia system
R System ID (anonymized)
The transfer of this data is used to optimize com‐
munication between the vehicle and the mobile

generated.

This has no connection to the vehicle identifica‐
tion number (VIN) and is deleted when the multi‐
media system is reset (/ page 326).
The following driving status data is transmitted:
R Transmission position engaged
R Distinction between parked, standstill, rolling

and driving

R Day/night mode of the instrument cluster
The transfer of this data is used to alter how
content is displayed to correspond to the driving
situation.
The following position data is transmitted:
R Coordinates
R Speed
R Compass direction
R Acceleration direction
This data is only transferred while the navigation
system is active, in order to improve it (e.g. so it
can continue functioning when in a tunnel).

Mercedes-Benz emergency call system
Information on the Mercedes-Benz emer‐
gency call system
Your vehicle is equipped with the Mercedes-Benz
emergency call system ("eCall"). This feature can
help save lives in the event of an accident. eCall
in no way replaces assistance provided from
dialing 911.
Mercedes-Benz eCall only functions in areas
where mobile phone coverage is available from
the wireless service providers. Insufficient net‐
work coverage from the wireless service provid‐
ers may result in an emergency call not being
transmitted.
eCall is a standard feature in your Mercedes-
Benz vehicle. In order to function as intended,
the system relies on the transmission of data
detailed in the "Mercedes-Benz emergency call
system data transmission" section that follows
(/ page 393).
To disable eCall, a customer must visit an
authorized Mercedes-Benz Service department
to deactivate the vehicle's communication mod‐
ule.

MBUX multimedia system 391

Deactivation of this module prevents the
activation of any and all Mercedes me con‐
nect services. After the deactivation of
eCall, automatic emergency call and manual
emergency call will not be available.
The ignition must be switched on before an auto‐
matic emergency call can be made.
% eCall is activated at the factory.
% eCall can be deactivated by an authorized
Mercedes-Benz dealer. Please note that in
the event ownership of the vehicle is trans‐
ferred to another owner in its deactivated
state, eCall will remain deactivated unless
the new owner visits an authorized
Mercedes-Benz dealership to reactivate the
system.

Overview of the Mercedes-Benz emergency
call system
eCall can help to reduce the time between an
accident and the arrival of emergency services
at the site of the accident. It helps locate an
accident site in places that are difficult to
access. However, even if a vehicle is equipped
with eCall, this does not mean the system is ON.

392 MBUX multimedia system

As such, eCall does not replace dialing 911 in the
event of an accident.
The emergency call can be made automatically
(/ page 392) or manually (/ page 393). Only
make emergency calls if you or others are in
need of rescue.
Only make emergency calls if you or others are
in need of rescue. Do not make an emergency
call in the event of a breakdown or a similar sit‐
uation.
Notification in the multimedia system dis‐
play:
SOS NOT READY: the ignition is not on or eCall
not available.
During an active emergency call, G appears
in the display.
You can find more information on the regional
availability of eCall at: http://www.mercedes-
benz.com/connect_ecall
% If there is a malfunction in the Mercedes-

Benz emergency call system (e.g. a malfunc‐
tion with the speaker, microphone, airbag,
SOS button), a corresponding message

appears in the multifunction display of the
instrument cluster.

Triggering an automatic Mercedes‑Benz
emergency call
Requirements
R The ignition is switched on.
R The starter battery is sufficiently charged.
The Mercedes‑Benz emergency call system trig‐
gers an emergency call automatically in the fol‐
lowing cases:
R After activation of the restraint systems such
as airbags or Emergency Tensioning Devices
after an accident.

R After an automatically initiated emergency

stop by Active Emergency Stop Assist.

The emergency call has been made:
R A voice connection is made to the

Mercedes‑Benz emergency call center.

R A message with accident data is transmitted

can transmit the vehicle position data to one
of the emergency call centers.

The SOS button in the overhead control panel
flashes until the emergency call is finished.
It is not possible to immediately end an auto‐
matic emergency call.
If no connection can be made to the emergency
services either, a corresponding message
appears in the media display.
# Dial the local emergency number on your

mobile phone.

If an emergency call has been initiated:
R Remain in the vehicle if the road and traffic
conditions permit you to do so until a voice
connection is established with the emer‐
gency call center operator.

R Based on the call, the operator decides

whether it is necessary to call rescue teams
and/or the police to the accident site.

R If no vehicle occupant answers, an ambu‐

lance is sent to the vehicle immediately.

Depending on how the vehicle is used, the
ASSYST PLUS service interval display may
shorten the service interval, e.g. in the following
cases:
R Mainly short-distance driving
R When the engine is often left idling for long

periods

R In the event of frequent cold start phases
Mercedes-Benz recommends avoiding such
operating conditions.
You can obtain information concerning the serv‐
icing of your vehicle from a qualified specialist

458 Wheels and tires

Notes on noise or unusual handling charac‐
teristics
While driving, pay attention to vibrations, noises
and unusual handling characteristics, e.g. pulling
to one side. This may indicate that the wheels or
tires are damaged. If you suspect that a tire is
defective, reduce your speed immediately. Stop
the vehicle as soon as possible to check the
wheels and tires for damage. Hidden tire dam‐
age could also be causing the unusual handling
characteristics. If you find no signs of damage,
have the tires and wheels checked at a qualified
specialist workshop.

Notes on regularly inspecting wheels and
tires

& WARNING Risk of accident from dam‐

aged tires

Damaged tires can cause tire pressure loss.
As a result, you could lose control of your
vehicle.

# Check the tires regularly for signs of

damage and replace any damaged tires
immediately.

& WARNING Risk of aquaplaning due to

insufficient tire tread

Insufficient tire tread will result in reduced
tire grip. The tire tread is no longer able to
dissipate water.
This means that in heavy rain or slush the
risk of hydroplaning is increased, in particu‐
lar if vehicle speed is not adapted to suit the
conditions.
If the tire pressure is too high or too low,
tires may exhibit different levels of wear at
different locations on the tire contact sur‐
face.
# Thus, you should regularly check the

tread depth and the condition of the tire
contact surface across the entire width
of all tires.

Minimum tread depth for:
R Summer tires: â in (3 mm)
R M+S tires: ã in (4 mm)
# For safety reasons, replace the tires
before the legally prescribed limit for
the minimum tread depth is reached.

Carry out the following checks on all wheels reg‐
ularly, at least once a month or as required, e.g.
prior to a long journey or driving off-road:
R Check the tire pressure (/ page 460).
R Visually inspect wheels and tires for damage.
R Check the valve caps.

The valves must be protected against mois‐
ture and dirt by the valve caps approved
especially for your vehicle by Mercedes-Benz.

R Visual check of the tire tread depth and the
tire contact surface across the entire width.
The minimum tread depth for summer tires is
â in (3 mm) and for winter tires ã in
(4 mm).

This could cause damage to the vehicle or
the tires.
# Never mount snow chains on the front

wheels.

# Only mount snow chains on the rear

wheels in pairs.

* NOTE Damage to the wheel trim from

mounted snow chains

If snow chains are mounted to steel wheels,
the wheel trims can be damaged.
# Remove the wheel trims of steel wheels

before mounting snow chains.

Observe the following notes when using snow
chains:
R Snow chains are only permissible for certain

Tire pressure
Notes on tire pressure

& WARNING Risk of accident due to insuf‐

ficient or excessive tire pressure

Underinflated or overinflated tires pose the
following risks:
R The tires may burst, especially as the

load and vehicle speed increase.

R The tires may wear excessively and/or
unevenly, which may greatly impair tire
traction.

R The driving characteristics, as well as
steering and braking, may be greatly
impaired.

# Comply with the recommended tire

pressure and check the tire pressure of
all tires including the spare wheel regu‐
larly:

R at least once a month
R when the load changes

R before embarking on a longer journey
R if operating conditions change, e.g. off-

road driving

# Adjust the tire pressure as necessary.

Tire pressure which is too high or too low can:
R Shorten the service life of the tires.
R Cause increased tire damage.
R Adversely affect driving characteristics and
thus driving safety, e.g. due to hydroplaning.

& WARNING Risk of an accident due to

insufficient tire pressure

Tires with pressure that is too low can over‐
heat and burst as a result.
In addition, they also suffer from excessive
and/or irregular wear, which can significantly
impair the braking properties and the han‐
dling characteristics.
# Avoid excessively low tire pressures in
all the tires, including the spare wheel.

Tire pressure which is too low can cause:
R Tire defects as a result of overheating.
R Impaired handling characteristics.
R Irregular wear.
R Increased fuel consumption.

& WARNING Risk of accident from exces‐

sive tire pressure

Tires with excessively high pressure can
burst because they are damaged more easily
by highway fill, pot holes etc.
In addition, they also suffer from irregular
wear, which can significantly impair the brak‐
ing properties and the handling characteris‐
tics.
# Avoid excessively high tire pressures in
all the tires, including the spare wheel.

Tire pressure which is too high can cause:
R Increased braking distance.
R Impaired handling characteristics.
R Irregular wear.

You can find information on tire pressure for the
vehicle's factory-installed tires on the following
labels:
R Tire and Loading Information placard on the

B‑pillar of your vehicle (/ page 467).

R Tire pressure table on the inside of the fuel

filler flap (/ page 461).

Observe the maximum tire pressure
(/ page 473).
Use a suitable pressure gauge to check the tire
pressure. The outer appearance of a tire does
not permit any reliable conclusion about the tire
pressure.
Vehicles with a tire pressure monitoring sys‐
tem: You can also check the tire pressure using
the on-board computer.
Only correct tire pressure when the tires are
cold. Conditions for cold tires:
R The vehicle has been parked with the tires

out of direct sunlight for at least three hours.

R The vehicle has traveled less than 1 mile

A rise in the tire temperature of 18 °F (10 °C)
increases the tire pressure by approx. 10 kPa
(0.1 bar/1.5 psi). Take this into account when
checking the tire pressure of warm tires.
The tire pressure recommended for increased
load/speed in the tire pressure table can affect
the ride comfort.

& WARNING Risk of accident due to
unsuitable accessories on tire valve

If you mount unsuitable accessories onto tire
valves, the tire valves may be overloaded and
malfunction, which can cause a loss of tire
pressure. Aftermarket tire pressure monitor‐
ing systems will cause the tire valve to
remain open, depending on the design. This
can also result in a loss of tire pressure.
# Only screw standard valve caps or valve

caps specifically approved by
Mercedes-Benz for your vehicle onto
the tire valve.

Trailer operation notes
Always inflate the rear axle tires to the recom‐
mended tire pressure on the tire pressure table

Tire pressure monitoring system
Function of the tire pressure monitoring sys‐
tem

& DANGER Risk of accident due to incor‐

rect tire pressure

Each tire, including the spare (if provided),
should be checked monthly when cold and
inflated to the inflation pressure recommen‐
ded by the vehicle manufacturer on the vehi‐
cle placard or tire inflation pressure label. (If
your vehicle has tires of a different size than
the size indicated on the vehicle placard or
the tire inflation pressure label, you should
determine the proper tire inflation pressure
for those tires).

As an added safety feature, your vehicle has
been equipped with a tire pressure monitor‐
ing system (TPMS) that illuminates a low tire
pressure telltale when one or more of your
tires is significantly under-inflated. Accord‐
ingly, when the low tire pressure telltale illu‐
minates, you should stop and check your
tires as soon as possible, and inflate them to
the proper pressure. Driving on a signifi‐
cantly under-inflated tire causes the tire to
overheat and can lead to tire failure. Under-
inflation also reduces fuel efficiency and tire
tread life, and may affect the vehicle’s han‐
dling and stopping ability.
Please note that the TPMS is not a substitute
for proper tire maintenance, and it is the
driver’s responsibility to maintain correct tire
pressure, even if under-inflation has not
reached the level to trigger illumination of
the TPMS low tire pressure telltale.
Your vehicle has also been equipped with a
TPMS malfunction indicator to indicate when
the system is not operating properly. The
TPMS malfunction indicator is combined with

Wheels and tires 463

the low tire pressure telltale. When the sys‐
tem detects a malfunction, the telltale will
flash for approximately one minute and then
remain continuously illuminated. This
sequence will continue upon subsequent
vehicle start-ups as long as the malfunction
exists.
When the malfunction indicator is illumina‐
ted, the system may not be able to detect or
signal low tire pressure as intended. TPMS
malfunctions may occur for a variety of rea‐
sons, including the installation of replace‐
ment or alternate tires or wheels on the vehi‐
cle that prevent the TPMS from functioning
properly.
Always check the TPMS malfunction telltale
after replacing one or more tires or wheels
on your vehicle to ensure that the replace‐
ment or alternate tires and wheels allow the
TPMS to continue to function properly.

The system checks the tire pressure and the tire
temperature of the tires installed on the vehicle
by means of a tire pressure sensor.

464 Wheels and tires

New tire pressure sensor, e.g. in winter tires, are
automatically taught-in during the first journey
they are used.
The tire pressure and the tire temperature
appear in the multifunction display

If there is a substantial pressure loss or if the
tire temperature is excessive, you will be warned
in the following ways:
R via display messages (/ page 546)
R via the h warning lamp in the instrument

cluster (/ page 566)

The tire pressure monitoring system is only an
aid. It is the driver's responsibility to set the tire
pressure to the recommended cold tire pressure
suitable for the operating situation. Set the tire
pressure for cold tires using a tire pressure
gauge. Note that the correct tire pressure for the
current operating situation must first be taught-
in to the tire pressure monitoring system.
In most cases, the tire pressure monitoring sys‐
tem will automatically update the new reference
values after you have changed the tire pressure.
You can, however, also update the reference val‐

ues by restarting the tire pressure monitoring
system manually (/ page 465).

Steps for Determining Correct Load Limit
The following steps have been developed as
required of all manufacturers under Title 49,
Code of U.S. Federal Regulations, Part 575, pur‐
suant to the "National Traffic and Motor Vehicle
Safety Act of 1966".

# (1): Locate the statement "The combined

weight of occupants and cargo should never
exceed XXX kg or XXX lbs." on your vehicle's
placard.

# (2): Determine the combined weight of the
driver and passengers that will be riding in
your vehicle.

# (3): Subtract the combined weight of the

driver and passengers from XXX kg or
XXX lbs.

# (4): The resulting figure equals the available
amount of cargo and luggage load capacity.
For example, if the "XXX" amount equals
1400 lbs. and there will be five 150 lb pas‐
sengers in your vehicle, the amount of availa‐
ble cargo and luggage load capacity is
650 lbs. (1400 - 750 (5 x 150) = 650 lbs.)

# (5): Determine the combined weight of lug‐
gage and cargo being loaded on the vehicle.
The weight may not safely exceed the availa‐
ble cargo and luggage load capacity calcula‐
ted in Step 4.

# (6): If your vehicle will be towing a trailer,
load from your trailer will be transferred to

your vehicle. Consult this manual to deter‐
mine how this reduces the available cargo
and luggage load capacity of your vehicle.

% Not all vehicles are permitted to tow a

trailer. Towing a trailer is only permitted if a
trailer-hitch is installed. Please consult an
authorized Mercedes-Benz dealer if you have
any questions about towing a trailer with
your vehicle.

Even if you have calculated the total load care‐
fully, you should still make sure that the maxi‐
mum permissible gross weight and the maxi‐
mum gross axle weight rating of your vehicle are
not exceeded. Details can be found on the vehi‐
cle identification plate.
# Have your loaded vehicle – including driver,
occupants and load – weighed on a vehicle
weighbridge.
The measured values may not exceed the
maximum permissible values stated on the
vehicle identification plate.

Tire Quality Grading
In accordance with the US Department of Trans‐
portation's "Uniform Tire Quality Grading Stand‐
ards", tire manufacturers are required to grade
their tires on the basis of the following three per‐
formance factors:

Wheels and tires 471

1 Tread wear grade
2 Traction grade
3 Temperature grade
% The data shown in the illustration is example

data.

% The classification is not legally stipulated for

Canada, but it is generally stated.

Tread wear grade
The tread wear grade is a comparative rating
based on the wear rate of the tire when tested
under controlled conditions on a specified test
track of the US Department of Transportation.
For example, a tire graded 150 would wear one

472 Wheels and tires

and one-half times as well on the government
test track as a tire graded 100.
The relative performance of tires depends upon
the actual conditions of their use, however, and
may depart significantly from the norm due to
variations in driving habits, service practices and
differences in road characteristics and climate
conditions.
Traction grade

& DANGER Risk of accident due to inade‐

quate traction

The traction grade assigned to this tire is
based on straight-ahead braking traction
tests, and does not include either accelera‐
tion, cornering, hydroplaning or peak traction
characteristics.
# Always adapt your driving style and

drive at a speed to suit the prevailing
traffic and weather conditions.

* NOTE Damage to the drivetrain from

wheelspin

# Avoid wheelspin.

sure of all tires including the spare
wheel.

# Adjust the tire pressure as necessary.

The traction classes, from highest to lowest, are
AA, A, B and C. Those grades represent the tire's
ability to stop on wet pavement as measured
under controlled conditions on specified govern‐
ment test surfaces of asphalt and concrete. A
tire marked C may have poor traction perform‐
ance.
Temperature grade

& WARNING Risk of accident from tire

overheating and tire failure

The temperature grade for this tire is estab‐
lished for a tire that is properly inflated and
not overloaded. Excessive speed, underinfla‐
tion, or excessive loading, either separately
or in combination, can cause excessive heat
build-up and possible tire failure.
# Observe the recommended tire pres‐

sures and regularly check the tire pres‐

The temperature grades are A (the highest), B
and C. They represent the tire's resistance to the
generation of heat and its ability to dissipate
heat when tested under controlled conditions on
a specified indoor laboratory test wheel. Sus‐
tained high temperature can cause the material
of the tire to degenerate and reduce tire life, and
excessive temperature can lead to sudden tire
failure. Grade C corresponds to a level of per‐
formance which all passenger car tires must
meet under the Federal Motor Safety Standard
No. 109. Grades B and A represent higher levels
of performance on the laboratory test wheel
than the minimum required by law.

DOT, Tire Identification Number (TIN)
US tire regulations stipulate that every tire man‐
ufacturer or retreader must imprint a TIN in or
on the side wall of each tire produced.

marked tires fulfill the requirements of the
US Department of Transportation.
Average weight of the vehicle occupants: the
number of vehicle occupants for which the vehi‐
cle is designed, multiplied by 150 lb (68 kg).

Uniform Tire Quality Grading Standards: a
uniform standard to grade the quality of tires
with regard to tread quality, tire traction and
temperature characteristics. The quality grading
assessment is made by the manufacturer follow‐
ing specifications from the U.S. government. The
quality grade of a tire is imprinted on the side
wall of the tire.
Recommended tire pressure: the recommen‐
ded tire pressure is the tire pressure specified
for the tires mounted to the vehicle at the fac‐
tory.
The tire and information table contains the rec‐
ommended tire pressures for cold tires, the max‐
imum permissible load and the maximum per‐
missible vehicle speed.
The tire pressure table contains the recommen‐
ded tire pressures for cold tires under various
operating conditions, i.e. loading and/or speed
of the vehicle.
Increased vehicle weight due to optional
equipment: the combined weight of all standard
and optional equipment available for the vehicle,

regardless of whether it is actually installed on
the vehicle or not.
Rim: the part of the wheel on which the tire is
installed.
GAWR (Gross Axle Weight Rating): the GAWR
is the maximum permissible axle load. The
actual load on an axle must never exceed the
gross axle weight rating. The gross axle weight
rating can be found on the vehicle identification
plate on the B‑pillar on the driver's side.
Speed rating: the speed rating is part of the tire
identification. It specifies the speed range for
which a tire is approved.
GVW (Gross Vehicle Weight): the gross vehicle
weight comprises the weight of the vehicle
including fuel, tools, the spare wheel, accesso‐
ries installed, occupants, luggage and the trailer
drawbar noseweight, if applicable. The gross
vehicle weight must not exceed the gross vehicle

mum permissible tire pressure for one tire.
Maximum load on one tire: maximum load on
one tire. This is calculated by dividing the maxi‐
mum axle load of one axle by two.
PSI (pounds per square inch): standard unit of
measurement for tire pressure.
Aspect ratio: ratio between tire height and tire
width in percent.
Tire pressure: pressure inside the tire applying
an outward force to every square inch of the tire.
The tire pressure is specified in pounds per
square inch (psi), in kilopascals (kPa) or in bar.
The tire pressure should only be corrected when
the tires are cold.
Cold tire pressure: the tires are cold when the
vehicle has been parked for at least 3 hours

without direct sunlight on the tires or the vehicle
has been driven for less than 1 mile (1.6 km).
Tire contact surface: the part of the tire that
comes into contact with the road.
Tire bead: the purpose of the tire bead is to
ensure that the tire sits securely on the wheel
rim. There are several wire cores in the tire bead

* NOTE Vehicle and tire damage through
tire types and sizes that have not been
approved

For safety reasons, only use tires, wheels
and accessories which have been specially
approved by Mercedes-Benz for your vehicle.
These tires are specially adapted to the con‐
trol systems, such as ABS, ESP® and
4MATIC, and marked as follows:
R MO = Mercedes-Benz Original
R MOE = Mercedes-Benz Original Extended

(run-flat tire only for certain wheels)

R MO1 = Mercedes-Benz Original (only cer‐

tain AMG tires)

Certain characteristics, such as handling,
vehicle noise emissions, fuel consumption,
etc. may otherwise be adversely affected.
Furthermore, other tire sizes could result in
the tires rubbing against the body and axle
components when loaded. This could result
in damage to the tire or the vehicle.

480 Wheels and tires

Only use tires, wheels and accessories that
have been checked and recommended by
Mercedes-Benz.

* NOTE Risk to driving safety from retrea‐

ded tires

Retreaded tires are neither tested nor recom‐
mended by Mercedes-Benz, since previous
damage cannot always be detected on
retreaded tires.
For this reason driving safety cannot be guar‐
anteed.
# Do not use used tires if you have no

information about their previous usage.

* NOTE Possible damage to wheels or tires

when driving over obstacles

Large wheels have a lower tire section width.
The lower the tire section width, the greater
is the risk of damage to wheels or tires when
driving over obstacles.

# Avoid obstacles or drive particularly

carefully.

* NOTE Damage to electronic component
parts from the use of tire-mounting tools

Vehicles with a tire pressure monitoring
system: Electronic component parts are
located in the wheel. Tire-mounting tools
should not be used in the area of the valve.
This could otherwise damage the electronic
component parts.
# Have the tires changed at a qualified

specialist workshop only.

* NOTE Damage to summer tires at low

ambient temperatures

At low ambient temperatures, tears could
form when driving with summer tires, caus‐
ing permanent damage to the tires.
# At temperatures below 45 °F (7 °C),

use M+S tires .

Accessory parts that are not approved for your
vehicle by Mercedes-Benz or are not being used
correctly can impair the operating safety.
Before purchasing and using non-approved
accessories, visit a qualified specialist workshop
and inquire about:
R Suitability
R Legal stipulations
R Factory recommendations

& WARNING Risk of accident with high

performance tires

The special tire tread in combination with the
optimized tire compound means that the risk
of skidding or hydroplaning on wet roads is
increased.
In addition, the tire grip is greatly reduced at
a low outside temperature and tire running
temperature.
# Switch on the ESP® and adapt your

driving style accordingly.

# Use M+S tire at outside temperatures

of less than 10 °C (50 °F).
