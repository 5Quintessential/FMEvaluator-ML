3WARNING

California Proposition 65 Warning

Operating, servicing and maintaining a 
passenger vehicle or off-highway motor 
vehicle can expose you to chemicals including 
engine exhaust, carbon monoxide, 
phthalates, and lead, which are known to the 
State of California to cause cancer and birth 
defects or other reproductive harm. To 
minimize exposure, avoid breathing exhaust, 
do not idle the engine except as necessary, 
service your vehicle in a well-ventilated area 
and wear gloves or wash your hands 
frequently when servicing your vehicle. For 
more information go to 
www.P65Warnings.ca.gov/passenger-vehicle.

Event Data Recorders
This vehicle is equipped with an event data recorder (EDR). 
The main purpose of an EDR is to record, in certain crash or near 
crash-like situations, such as an air bag deployment or hitting a 
road obstacle, data that will assist in understanding how a vehicle’s 
systems performed. The EDR is designed to record data related 
to vehicle dynamics and safety systems for a short period of 
time, typically 30 seconds or less. The EDR in this vehicle is 
designed to record such data as:
• How various systems in your vehicle were operating;
• Whether or not the driver and passenger safety belts were 

buckled/fastened;

• How far (if at all) the driver was depressing the accelerator 

and/or brake pedal; and,

• How fast the vehicle was traveling.
These data can help provide a better understanding of the 
circumstances in which crashes and injuries occur. NOTE: EDR data 
are recorded by your vehicle only if a non-trivial crash situation 
occurs; no data are recorded by the EDR under normal driving 
conditions and no personal data (e.g., name, gender, age, and 
crash location) are recorded. However, other parties, such as law 
enforcement, could combine the EDR data with the type of 
personally identifying data routinely acquired during a crash 
investigation.

To read data recorded by an EDR, special equipment is required, 
and access to the vehicle or the EDR is needed. In addition to the 
vehicle manufacturer, other parties, such as law enforcement, that 
have the special equipment, can read the information if they have 
access to the vehicle or the EDR.

The data belongs to the vehicle owner and may not be accessed by 
anyone else except as legally required or with the permission of the 
vehicle owner.

Service Diagnostic Recorders
This vehicle is equipped with service-related devices that record 
information about powertrain performance. The data can be used 
to verify emissions law requirements and/or help technicians 
diagnose and solve service problems. It may also be combined with 
data from other sources for research purposes, but it remains 
confidential. Some diagnostic and maintenance information is 
uploaded to Honda upon vehicle start up.

For Safe Driving

The following pages explain your vehicle’s safety features and how to use them 
properly. The safety precautions below are ones that we consider to be among the 
most important.

Important Safety Precautions
■ Always wear your seat belt
A seat belt is your best protection in all types of collisions. Airbags are designed to 
supplement seat belts, not replace them. So even though your vehicle is equipped 
with airbags, make sure you and your passengers always wear your seat belts, and 
wear them properly.

■ Restrain all children
Children ages 12 and under should ride properly restrained in a back seat, not the 
front seat. Infants and small children should be restrained in a child seat. Larger 
children should use a booster seat and a lap/shoulder seat belt until they can use the 
belt properly without a booster seat.

■ Be aware of airbag hazards
While airbags can save lives, they can cause serious or fatal injuries to occupants 
who sit too close to them, or are not properly restrained. Infants, young children, 
and short adults are at the greatest risk. Be sure to follow all instructions and 
warnings in this manual.

■ Don’t drink and drive
Alcohol and driving don’t mix. Even one drink can reduce your ability to respond to 
changing conditions, and your reaction time gets worse with every additional drink. 
So don’t drink and drive, and don’t let your friends drink and drive, either.

1Important Safety Precautions

Some states, provinces and territories prohibit the use 
of cell phones other than hands-free devices by the 
driver while driving.

19 ODYSSEY-31THR6100.book  35 ページ  ２０１８年３月１２日　月曜日　午後７時３３分

uuFor Safe DrivinguImportant Safety Precautions

■ Pay appropriate attention to the task of driving safely
Engaging in cell phone conversation or other activities that keep you from paying 
close attention to the road, other vehicles, and pedestrians could lead to a crash. 
Remember, situations can change quickly, and only you can decide when it is safe to 
divert some attention away from driving.

■ Control your speed
Excessive speed is a major factor in crash injuries and deaths. Generally, the higher 
the speed, the greater the risk, but serious injuries can also occur at lower speeds. 
Never drive faster than is safe for current conditions, regardless of the maximum 
speed posted.

■ Keep your vehicle in safe condition
Having a tire blowout or a mechanical failure can be extremely hazardous.
To reduce the possibility of such problems, check your tire pressures and condition 
frequently, and perform all regularly scheduled maintenance.

■ Do not leave children unattended in the vehicle
Children left unattended in the vehicle may be injured if they activate one or more 
of the vehicle controls. They may also cause the vehicle to move, resulting in a crash 
in which the children and/or another person(s) can be injured or killed. Also, 
depending on the ambient temperature, the temperature of the interior may reach 
extreme levels, which can result in injury or death.
Even if the climate control system is on, never leave children in the vehicle 
unattended as the climate control system can shut off at any time.

1Your Vehicle’s Safety Features

Your vehicle is equipped with many features that 
work together to help protect you and your 
passengers during a crash.

Some features do not require any action on your part. 
These include a strong steel framework that forms a 
safety cage around the passenger compartment, 
front and rear crush zones, a collapsible steering 
column, and tensioners that tighten the front seat 
belts in a sufficient crash.

However, you and your passengers cannot take full 
advantage of these features unless you remain seated 
in the correct position and always wear your seat 
belts. In fact, some safety features can contribute to 
injuries if they are not used properly.

uuFor Safe DrivinguSafety CheckList

1Safety CheckList

If the door and/or tailgate open message appears on 
the driver information interface, a door and/or the 
tailgate is not completely closed. Close all doors and 
the tailgate tightly until the message disappears.

2 Driver Information Interface Warning and 

Information Messages P. 102

19 ODYSSEY-31THR6100.book  37 ページ  ２０１８年３月１２日　月曜日　午後７時３３分

Safety CheckList
For the safety of you and your passengers, make a habit of checking these items 
each time before you drive.
• After everyone has entered the vehicle, be sure all doors and the tailgate are 

closed and locked. Locking the doors and the tailgate helps prevent an occupant 
from being ejected and an outsider from unexpectedly opening a door or the 
tailgate.

2 Locking/Unlocking the Doors from the Inside P. 154

• Adjust your seat to a position suitable for driving. Be sure the front seats are 
adjusted as far to the rear as possible while allowing the driver to control the 
vehicle. Sitting too close to a front airbag can result in serious or fatal injury in a 
crash.

2 Adjusting the Seats P. 209

• Adjust head restraints to the proper position. Head restraints are most effective 
when the center of the head restraint aligns with the center of your head. Taller 
persons should adjust their head restraint to the highest position.

2 Adjusting the Front and Second Row Outer and Third Row Outer Head 

• Always wear your seat belt, and make sure you wear it properly. Confirm that any 

Restraints Positions P. 212

passengers are properly belted as well.

2 Fastening a Seat Belt P. 41

and weight.

2 Child Safety P. 62

Seat Belts

About Your Seat Belts
Seat belts are the single most effective safety device because they keep you 
connected to the vehicle so that you can take advantage of many built-in safety 
features. They also help keep you from being thrown against the inside of the 
vehicle, against any passengers, or out of the vehicle. When worn properly, seat 
belts also keep your body properly positioned in a crash so that you can take full 
advantage of the additional protection provided by the airbags.

In addition, seat belts help protect you in almost every type of crash, including:
- frontal impacts
- side impacts
- rear impacts
- rollovers

■ Lap/shoulder seat belts
All seven or eight seating positions are equipped with lap/shoulder seat belts with 
emergency locking retractors. In normal driving the retractor lets you move freely 
while keeping some tension on the belt.
During a collision or sudden stop the retractor locks to restrain your body. The front, 
second, and third row passenger’s seat belts also have a lockable retractor for use 
with child seats.

1About Your Seat Belts

3WARNING

Not wearing a seat belt properly increases 
the chance of serious injury or death in a 
crash, even though your vehicle has 
airbags.

Be sure you and your passengers always 
wear seat belts and wear them properly.

Seat belts cannot completely protect you in every 
crash. But in most cases, seat belts can reduce your 
risk of serious injury.

Most states and all Canadian provinces and territories 
require you to wear seat belts.

If you extend the seat belt too quickly, it will lock in 
place. If this happens, slightly retract the seat belt, 
then extend it slowly.

■ Proper use of seat belts
Follow these guidelines for proper use:
• All occupants should sit upright, well back in the seat, and remain in that position 
for the duration of the trip. Slouching and leaning reduce the effectiveness of the 
belt and can increase the chance of serious injury in a crash.

• Never place the shoulder part of a lap/shoulder seat belt under your arm or 

behind your back. This could cause very serious injuries in a crash.

• Two people should never use the same seat belt. If they do, they could be very 

seriously injured in a crash.

• Do not put any accessories on the seat belts. Devices intended to improve comfort 
or reposition the shoulder part of a seat belt can reduce the protective capability 
and increase the chance of serious injury in a crash.

■ Seat Belt Reminder

uuSeat BeltsuAbout Your Seat Belts

1About Your Seat Belts

If a rear seat passenger moves around and extends 
the seat belt, the lockable retractor may activate. If 
this happens, release the retractor by unfastening the 
seat belt and allow the belt to retract completely. 
Then refasten the belt.

1Seat Belt Reminder

The indicator will also come on if a front passenger 
does not fasten their seat belt within 6 seconds after 
the power mode is set to ON.
When no one is sitting in the front passenger’s seat, 
the indicator will not come on and the beeper will not 
sound. The indicator also may not come on and the 
beeper may not sound when the occupant is not 
heavy enough to trigger the weight sensor. Such 
occupants (e.g., infants and smaller children) should 
be moved to the rear seat as a deploying front airbag 
likely will injure or kill them.

2 Protecting Child Passengers P. 62

The seat belt system includes an indicator on 
the instrument panel to remind the driver or a 
front passenger or both to fasten their seat 
belts.
If you set the power mode to ON and a seat 
belt is not fastened, a beeper will sound and 
the indicator will blink. After a few seconds, 
the beeper will stop and the indicator will 
come on and remain illuminated until the seat 
belt is fastened.

The beeper will periodically sound and the 
indicator will blink while the vehicle is moving 
until the seat belt is fastened.

uuSeat BeltsuAbout Your Seat Belts

■ Automatic Seat Belt Tensioners
The front seats are equipped with automatic seat belt tensioners to enhance safety.

The tensioners automatically tighten the front seat belts during a moderate-to-
severe frontal collision, sometimes even if the collision is not severe enough to 
inflate the front airbags or the knee airbags.

1Automatic Seat Belt Tensioners

The seat belt tensioners can only operate once.
If a tensioner is activated, the SRS indicator will come 
on. Have a dealer replace the tensioner and 
thoroughly inspect the seat belt system as it may not 
offer protection in a subsequent crash.

During a moderate-to-severe side impact, the 
tensioner on that side of the vehicle also activates.

3. Position the lap part of the belt as low as 
possible across your hips, then pull up on 
the shoulder part of the belt so the lap part 
fits snugly. This lets your strong pelvic 
bones take the force of a crash and reduces 
the chance of internal injuries.

4. If necessary, pull up on the belt again to 

remove any slack, then check that the belt 
rests across the center of your chest and 
over your shoulder. This spreads the forces 
of a crash over the strongest bones in your 
upper body.

1Fastening a Seat Belt

3WARNING

Improperly positioning the seat belts can 
cause serious injury or death in a crash.

Make sure all seat belts are properly 
positioned before driving.

To release the belt, push the red PRESS button and 
then guide the belt by hand until it has retracted 
completely.
When exiting the vehicle, be sure the belt is properly 
stowed so that it will not get caught in the closing 
door.

■ Adjusting the Shoulder Anchor
The front seats have adjustable shoulder anchors to accommodate taller and shorter 
occupants.

1Adjusting the Shoulder Anchor

The shoulder anchor height can be adjusted to four 
levels. If the belt contacts your neck, lower the height 
one level at a time.

■ Advice for Pregnant Women
If you are pregnant, the best way to protect yourself and your unborn child when 
driving or riding in a vehicle is to always wear a seat belt and keep the lap part of the 
belt as low as possible across the hips.

Wear the shoulder belt 
across the chest avoiding 
the abdomen.

uuSeat BeltsuFastening a Seat Belt

1Advice for Pregnant Women

Each time you have a checkup, ask your doctor if it is 
okay for you to drive.

To reduce the risk of injuries to both you and your 
unborn child that can be caused by an inflating front 
airbag:
• When driving, sit upright and adjust the seat as far 
back as possible while allowing full control of the 
vehicle.

• When sitting in the front passenger’s seat, adjust 

the seat as far back as possible.

u If a belt does not retract easily, cleaning the belt may correct the problem. Only 
use a mild soap and warm water. Do not use bleach or cleaning solvents. Make 
sure the belt is completely dry before allowing it to retract.

Any belt that is not in good condition or working properly will not provide proper 
protection and should be replaced as soon as possible.
A belt that has been worn during a crash may not provide the same level of 
protection in a subsequent crash. Have your seat belts inspected by a dealer after 
any collision.

■ Important facts about your airbags
Airbags can pose serious hazards. To do their job, airbags must inflate with 
tremendous force. So, while airbags help save lives, they can cause burns, bruises, 
and other minor injuries, sometimes even fatal ones if occupants are not wearing 
their seat belts properly and sitting correctly.

What you should do: Always wear your seat belt properly, and sit upright and as 
far back from the steering wheel as possible while allowing full control of the 
vehicle. A front passenger should move their seat as far back from the dashboard as 
possible.

Remember, however, that no safety system can prevent all injuries or deaths that 
can occur in a severe crash, even when seat belts are properly worn and the airbags 
deploy.

Do not place hard or sharp objects between yourself and a front airbag. 
Carrying hard or sharp objects on your lap, or driving with a pipe or other sharp 
object in your mouth, can result in injuries if your front airbag inflates.

Do not attach or place objects on the front airbag and front knee airbag 
covers. Objects on the covers marked SRS AIRBAG could interfere with the proper 
operation of the airbags or be propelled inside the vehicle and hurt someone if the 
airbags inflate.

uuAirbagsuTypes of Airbags

Types of Airbags
Your vehicle is equipped with four types of airbags:
• Front airbags: Airbags in front of the driver’s and front passenger’s seats.
• Front knee airbags: Airbags under the steering column and glove box.
• Side airbags: Airbags in the driver’s and front passenger’s seat-backs.
• Side curtain airbags: Airbags above the side windows.
Each is discussed in the following pages.

Front Airbags (SRS)
The front SRS airbags inflate in a moderate-to-severe frontal collision to help protect 
the head and chest of the driver and/or front passenger.

SRS (Supplemental Restraint System) indicates that the airbags are designed to 
supplement seat belts, not replace them. Seat belts are the occupant’s primary 
restraint system.

■ Housing Locations
The front airbags are housed in the center of the steering wheel for the driver, and 
in the dashboard for the front passenger. Both airbags are marked SRS AIRBAG.

1Types of Airbags

The airbags can inflate whenever the power mode is 
in ON.

After an airbag inflates in a crash, you may see a 
small amount of smoke. This is from the combustion 
process of the inflator material and is not harmful. 
People with respiratory problems may experience 
some temporary discomfort. If this occurs, get out of 
the vehicle as soon as it is safe to do so.

1Front Airbags (SRS)

During a frontal crash severe enough to cause one or 
both front airbags to deploy, the airbags can inflate 
at different rates, depending on the severity of the 
crash, whether or not the seat belts are latched, and/
or other factors. Frontal airbags are designed to 
supplement the seat belts to help reduce the 
likelihood of head and chest injuries in frontal 
crashes.

■ Operation
Front airbags are designed to inflate during moderate-to-severe frontal collisions. 
When the vehicle decelerates suddenly, the sensors send information to the control 
unit which signals one or both front airbags to inflate.

A frontal collision can be either head-on or angled between two vehicles, or when a 
vehicle crashes into a stationary object, such as a concrete wall.

■ How the Front Airbags Work

uuAirbagsuFront Airbags (SRS)

 

S
a
f
e
D
r
i
v
i
n
g

While your seat belt restrains your torso, the 
front airbag provides supplemental protection 
for your head and chest.

The front airbags deflate immediately so that 
they won’t interfere with the driver’s visibility 
or the ability to steer or operate other 
controls.

1How the Front Airbags Work

Although the driver’s and front passenger’s airbags 
normally inflate within a split second of each other, it 
is possible for only one airbag to deploy. This can 
happen if the severity of a collision is at the margin, 
or threshold, that determines whether or not the 
airbags will deploy. In such cases, the seat belt will 
provide sufficient protection, and the supplemental 
protection offered by the airbag would be minimal.

The total time for inflation and deflation is so fast that most occupants are not 
aware that the airbags deployed until they see them lying in front of them.

uuAirbagsuFront Airbags (SRS)

■ When front airbags should not deploy
Minor frontal crashes: Front airbags were designed to supplement seat belts and 
help save lives, not to prevent minor scrapes, or even broken bones that might occur 
during a less than moderate-to-severe frontal crash.
Side impacts: Front airbags can provide protection when a sudden deceleration 
causes a driver or front passenger to move towards the front of the vehicle. Side 
airbags and side curtain airbags have been specifically designed to help reduce the 
severity of injuries that can occur during a moderate-to-severe side impact which 
can cause the driver or passenger to move towards the side of the vehicle.
Rear impacts: Head restraints and seat belts are your best protection during a rear 
impact. Front airbags cannot provide any significant protection and are not designed 
to deploy in such collisions.
Rollovers: In a rollover, your best form of protection is a seat belt or, if your vehicle 
is equipped with a rollover sensor, both a seat belt and a side curtain airbag. Front 
airbags, however, are not designed to deploy in a rollover as they would provide 
little if any protection.
■ When front airbags deploy with little or no visible damage
Because the airbag system senses sudden deceleration, a strong impact to the 
vehicle framework or suspension might cause one or more of the airbags to deploy. 
Examples include running into a curb, the edge of a hole, or other low fixed object 
that causes a sudden deceleration in the vehicle chassis. Since the impact is 
underneath the vehicle, damage may not be readily apparent.
■ When front airbags may not deploy, even though exterior damage 

appears severe

Since crushable body parts absorb crash energy during an impact, the amount of 
visible damage does not always indicate proper airbag operation. In fact, some 
collisions can result in severe damage but no airbag deployment because the airbags 
would not have been needed or would not have provided protection even if they 
had deployed.

■ Advanced Airbags
The airbags have advanced features to help reduce the likelihood of airbag related 
injuries to smaller occupants.

1Advanced Airbags

Driver’s 
Seat 
Position 
Sensor

The driver’s advanced airbag system includes a 
seat position sensor.

Based on information from this sensor and the 
severity of the impact, the advanced airbag 
system determines the optimal deployment of 
the driver’s airbag.

The front passenger’s advanced airbag system 
has weight sensors.

We advise against allowing a child age 12 or 
under to ride in the front passenger’s seat. 
However, if you do allow a child age 12 or 
under to ride in the front passenger’s 
seat, note that the system will automatically 
turn off the front passenger’s airbag if the 
sensors detect that the child is approximately 
65 lbs (29 kg) or less.

Passenger’s 
Seat Weight 
Sensors

uuAirbagsuFront Airbags (SRS)

If there is a problem with the driver’s seat position 
sensor, the SRS indicator will come on, and in the 
event of a crash, the airbag will deploy (regardless of 
the driver’s seating position) with a force 
corresponding to the severity of the impact.

For the advanced airbags to work properly:
• Do not spill any liquid on or under the seats.
• Do not put any object under the passenger’s seat.
• Make sure any objects are positioned properly on 

the floor. Improperly positioned objects can 
interfere with the advanced airbag sensors.

• All occupants should sit upright and wear their seat 

belts properly.

• Do not cover the passenger’s side dashboard with 

a cloth, towel, cover, etc.

may be little or no damage, but the side impact sensors detected a severe enough 
impact to deploy the airbag.

■ When a side airbag may not deploy, even though visible damage appears 

severe

It is possible for a side airbag to not deploy during an impact that results in 
apparently severe damage. This can occur when the point of impact was toward the 
far front or rear of the vehicle, or when the vehicle’s crushable body parts absorbed 
most of the crash energy. In either case, the side airbag would not have been 
needed nor provided protection even if it had deployed.

Side Curtain Airbags
The side curtain airbags help protect the heads of the driver and passengers in the 
outer seating positions during a moderate-to-severe side impact. The side curtain 
airbags equipped in this vehicle are also designed to help reduce the likelihood of 
partial and complete ejection of vehicle occupants through side windows in crashes, 
particularly rollover crashes.

■ Housing Locations

The side curtain airbags are located in the 
ceiling above the side windows on both sides 
of the vehicle.

1Side Curtain Airbags

If the SRS control unit senses that your vehicle is 
about to rollover, it immediately deploys both side 
curtain airbags and activates both front seat belt 
tensioners.

If the impact is on the passenger’s side, the 
passenger’s side curtain airbag deploys even if there 
are no occupants on that side of the vehicle.

To get the best protection from the side curtain 
airbags, occupants should wear their seat belts 
properly and sit upright and well back in their seats.

Do not attach any objects to the side windows or roof 
pillars as they can interfere with the proper operation 
of the side curtain airbags.

The indicator comes on to alert you that the 
passenger’s front airbag has been turned off.
This occurs when the weight sensors detect 
about 65 lbs (29 kg) or less, the weight of an 
infant or small child, on the seat.

Children age 12 or under should always ride properly restrained in a back seat.

2 Child Safety P. 62

If the front passenger’s seat is empty, the indicator will come on and, in the event of 
a crash, the front passenger’s airbag will not deploy. The front passenger’s knee 
airbag will not deploy either.

To ensure the passenger is detected properly, confirm 
that:
• There is no child seat or other object pressing 

against the rear of the seat-back.

• There is no rear passenger pushing or pulling on 

the back of the front passenger’s seat.

• The front seat or seat-back is not forced back 
against an object on the seat or floor behind it.

• There is no object placed under or beside the front 

passenger’s seat.

• The occupant is sitting in an upright position and 

the seat back is not excessively reclined.

Airbag Care
You do not need to, and should not, perform any maintenance on or replace any 
airbag system components yourself. However, you should have your vehicle 
inspected by a dealer in the following situations:

■ When the airbags have deployed
If an airbag has inflated, the control unit and other related parts must be replaced. 
Similarly, once an automatic seat belt tensioner has been activated, it must be 
replaced.

■ When the vehicle has been in a moderate-to-severe collision
Even if the airbags did not inflate, have your dealer inspect the following: the driver’s 
seat position sensor, weight sensors in the passenger’s seat, front seat belt 
tensioners, and each seat belt that was worn during the crash.

■ Do not remove or modify a front seat without consulting a dealer
This would likely disable or affect the proper operation of the driver’s seat position 
sensor or the weight sensors in the passenger’s seat. If it is necessary to remove or 
modify a front seat to accommodate a person with disabilities, contact a Honda 
dealer, or for U.S. vehicles, American Honda Automobile Customer Service at 1-800-

Child Safety

Protecting Child Passengers
Each year, many children are injured or killed in vehicle crashes because they are 
either unrestrained or not properly restrained. In fact, vehicle crashes are the 
number one cause of death of children ages 12 and under.

To reduce the number of child deaths and injuries, every state, Canadian province 
and territory requires that infants and children be properly restrained when they ride 
in a vehicle.

Children should sit properly restrained in a rear seat. This is because:

• An inflating front or side airbag can injure 

or kill a child sitting in the front seat.

• A child in the front seat is more likely to 
interfere with the driver’s ability to safely 
control the vehicle.

• Statistics show that children of all sizes and 

ages are safer when they are properly 
restrained in a rear seat.

1Protecting Child Passengers

3WARNING

Children who are unrestrained or 
improperly restrained can be seriously 
injured or killed in a crash.

Any child too small for a seat belt should be 
properly restrained in a child seat. A larger 
child should be properly restrained with a 
seat belt, using a booster seat if necessary.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
and Transport Canada recommend that all children 
ages 12 and under be properly restrained in a rear 
seat. Some states or provinces/territories have laws 
restricting where children may ride.

• Any child who is too small to wear a seat belt correctly must be restrained in an 
approved child seat that is properly secured to the vehicle using either the seat 
belt or the lower anchors of the LATCH system.

1Protecting Child Passengers

3WARNING

• Never hold a child on your lap because it is impossible to protect them in the 

event of a collision.

• Never put a seat belt over yourself and a child. During a crash, the belt would 

likely press deep into the child and cause serious or fatal injuries.

• Never let two children use the same seat belt. Both children could be very 

seriously injured in a crash.

• Do not allow children to operate the doors, windows or seat adjustments.

• Do not leave children in the vehicle unattended, especially in hot weather when 
the inside of the vehicle can get hot enough to kill them. They could also activate 
vehicle controls causing it to move unexpectedly.

Allowing a child to play with a seat belt or 
wrap one around their neck can result in 
serious injury or death.

Instruct children not to play with any seat 
belt and make sure any unused seat belt a 
child can reach is buckled, fully retracted, 
and locked.

Safety of Infants and Small Children
■ Protecting Infants
An infant must be properly restrained in a rear-facing, reclining child seat until the 
infant reaches the seat manufacturer’s weight or height limit for the seat, and the 
infant is at least one year old.

■ Positioning a rear-facing child seat
Child seats must be placed and secured in a 
rear seating position.

When properly installed, a rear-facing child seat may prevent the driver or a front 
passenger from moving their seat all the way back, or from locking their seat-back 
in the desired position. Make sure that there is no contact between the child seat 
and the seat in front of it.

It can also interfere with proper operation of the passenger’s advanced front airbag 
system.

2 Airbags P. 47

If this occurs, we recommend that you install the child seat directly behind the front 
passenger’s seat, move the seat as far forward as needed, and leave it unoccupied. 
Or, you may wish to get a smaller rear-facing child seat.

3WARNING

Placing a rear-facing child seat in the front 
seat can result in serious injury or death 
during a crash.

Always place a rear-facing child seat in the 
rear seat, not the front.

Rear-facing child seats should never be installed in a 
forward facing position.

Always refer to the child seat manufacturer’s 
instructions before installation.

Do not allow a front seat to rest against a child seat 
installed in a rear seating position: The weight sensor 
in the front seat may not correctly detect the actual 
weight of the occupant.

■ Protecting Smaller Children
If a child is at least one year old and has exceeded the weight and height limitations 
of a rearward facing child seat, the child should be properly restrained in a firmly 
secured forward facing child seat until they exceed the weight and height limitations 
for the forward facing child seat.

■ Forward-facing child seat placement
We strongly recommend placing a forward-
facing child seat in a rear seating position.

uuChild SafetyuSafety of Infants and Small Children

3WARNING

Placing a forward-facing child seat in the 
front seat can result in serious injury or 
death if the front airbag inflates.

If you must place a forward-facing child 
seat in front, move the vehicle seat as far 
back as possible, and properly restrain the 
child.

■ Selecting a Child Seat
Most child seats are LATCH-compatible (Lower Anchors and Tethers for CHildren). 
Some have a rigid-type connector while others have a flexible-type connector. Both 
are equally easy to use. Some existing and previously owned child seats can only be 
installed using the seat belt. Whichever type you choose, follow the child seat 
manufacturer’s use and care instructions including recommended expiration dates 
as well as the instructions in this manual. Proper installation is key to maximizing 
your child’s safety.

1Selecting a Child Seat

Installation of a LATCH-compatible child seat is 
simple.

LATCH-compatible child seats have been developed 
to simplify the installation process and reduce the 
likelihood of injuries caused by incorrect installation.

In seating positions and vehicles not equipped with LATCH, a LATCH-compatible 
child seat can be installed using the seat belt and a top tether for added security. 
This is because all child seats are required to be designed so that they can be secured 
with a lap belt or the lap part of a lap/shoulder belt. In addition, the child seat 
manufacturer may advise that a seat belt be used to attach a LATCH-compatible seat 
once a child reaches a specified weight. Please read the child seat owner’s manual 
for proper installation instructions.

■ Important consideration when selecting a child seat
Make sure the child seat meets the following three requirements:
• The child seat is the correct type and size for the child.
• The child seat is the correct type for the seating position.
• The child seat is compliant with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 213 or 

Canadian Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 213.

Safety of Larger Children
■ Protecting Larger Children
The following pages give instructions on how to check proper seat belt fit, what kind 
of booster seat to use if one is needed, and important precautions for a child who 
must sit in front.

■ Checking Seat Belt Fit
When a child is too big for a child seat, secure the child in a rear seat using the lap/
shoulder seat belt. Have the child sit upright and all the way back, then answer the 
following questions.

■ Checklist
• Do the child’s knees bend comfortably over 

• Does the shoulder belt cross between the 

the edge of the seat?

child’s neck and arm?

• Is the lap part of the seat belt as low as 

possible, touching the child’s thighs?

• Will the child be able to stay seated like this 

for the whole trip?

If you answer yes to all these questions, the child is ready to wear the lap/shoulder 
seat belt correctly. If you answer no to any question, the child needs to ride on a 
booster seat until the seat belt fits properly without a booster seat.

There are high- and low-type booster seats. Choose a 
booster seat that allows the child to wear the seat 
belt correctly.

Some U.S. states and Canadian provinces and 
territories require children to use a booster seat until 
they reach a given age or weight (e.g. 6 years or 60 
lbs). Be sure to check current laws in the state or 
province, or territory where you intend to drive.

If a lap/shoulder seat belt cannot be used 
properly, position the child in a booster seat in 
the rear seat. For the child’s safety, check that 
the child meets the booster seat 
manufacturer’s recommendations.

consumes the remote’s battery.
Battery life is about two years, but this varies 
depending on regularity of use.
The battery is consumed whenever the remote is 
receiving strong radio waves. Avoid placing it near 
electrical appliances such as televisions and personal 
computers.

uuOperating the Switches Around the Steering WheeluAuto High-Beam*

Auto High-Beam*
Using a camera mounted to the inside of the windshield, this system detects light 
sources ahead of the vehicle. Depending on the light source, the system 
automatically switches the headlights to high beam for optimal visibility at night.
The system operates when:
■The headlight switch is in AUTO.
■The lever is in the low beam 

position.

■The low beams are on and the 
system recognizes that you are 
driving at night.

■The vehicle speed is above 45 mph 

(72 km/h).

C
o
n
t
r
o
l
s

How it works
When the camera detects lights coming from a preceding or oncoming vehicle, the 
headlights remain in low beam.
When the camera detects no lights coming from a preceding or oncoming vehicle, 
the headlights change to high beam.
The view angle or distance that the camera can detect lights ahead differs 
depending on conditions, such as the brightness of the lights and the weather.

1Auto High-Beam*

The auto high-beam determines when to change the 
headlight beams by responding to the brightness of 
the lights ahead of your vehicle. In the following 
cases, the system may not respond to the lights 
properly:
• The brightness of the lights from the preceding or 

oncoming vehicle is intense or poor.

• Visibility is poor due to the weather (rain, snow, 

fog, windshield frost, etc.).

• Other light sources, such as street lights and 

electric billboards are illuminating the road ahead.
• The brightness level of the road ahead constantly 

changes.

• The road is bumpy or with many curves.
• A vehicle cuts in front of you, or a vehicle in front 

of you is not in the preceding or oncoming 
direction.

• Your vehicle is tilted with a heavy load in the rear.

If you find the timing of beam changes inconvenient 
for driving, change the headlight beams manually.

If you do not want the system to be activated at any 
time when the headlight switch is in AUTO, consult a 
dealer or disable the system.

To activate the system, turn the headlight 
switch to AUTO and then set the headlights 
to low beam. The auto high-beam indicator 
will come on.

2 Light Switches P. 189

Headlight Switch

The high beams remain on unless:
• You have been driving below 45 mph (72 km/h) for an extended amount of time.
• The speed of the vehicle drops below 30 mph (48 km/h).
• The windshield wipers have been running at a high speed for more than a few 

seconds.

• You enter a well lit location.

The high beams come back on once the condition that caused them to turn off no 
longer exists.

If needed, you can temporarily turn the high beams off manually. Turn on the high 
beams by pushing the lever forward until you hear a click, or flash the high beams 
once by pulling the lever toward you. To turn the high beams back on, repeat one 
of the procedures.

C
o
n
t
r
o
l
s

For the auto high-beam to work properly:
• Do not place an object that reflects light on the 

dashboard.

• Keep the windshield around the camera clean. 

When cleaning the windshield, be careful not to 
apply windshield cleanser to the camera lens.

• Do not attach an object, sticker or film to the area 

around the camera.

• Do not touch the camera lens.

If the camera receives a strong impact, or repairing of 
the area near the camera is required, consult a dealer.

If the Some Driver Assist Systems Cannot 
Operate: Camera Temperature Too High message 
appears:
• Use the climate control system to cool down the 
interior and, if necessary, also use defroster mode 
with the airflow directed toward the camera.

• Start driving the vehicle to lower the windshield 
temperature, which cools down the area around 
the camera.

If the Some Driver Assist Systems Cannot 
Operate: Clean Front Windshield message 
appears:
• Park your vehicle in a safe place, and clean the 

windshield. If the message does not disappear after 
you have cleaned the windshield and driven for a 
while, have your vehicle checked by a dealer.

Adjust the driver’s seat-back to a comfortable, 
upright position, leaving ample space 
between your chest and the airbag cover in 
the center of the steering wheel.

The front seat passenger should also adjust 
their seat-back to a comfortable, upright 
position.

Reclining a seat-back so that the shoulder part of the belt no longer rests against the 
occupant’s chest reduces the protective capability of the belt. It also increases the 
chance of sliding under the belt in a crash and being seriously injured. The farther a 
seat-back is reclined, the greater the risk of injury.

uuAdjusting the SeatsuFront Seats

1Adjusting the Seat-Backs

3WARNING

Reclining the seat-back too far can result in 
serious injury or death in a crash.

Adjust the seat-back to an upright position, 
and sit well back in the seat.

Do not put a cushion, or other object, between the 
seat-back and your back.

Doing so may interfere with proper seat belt or airbag 
operation.

If you cannot get far enough away from the steering 
wheel and still reach the controls, we recommend 
that you investigate whether some type of adaptive 
equipment may help.

uuAdjusting the SeatsuHead Restraints

Head Restraints
Your vehicle is equipped with head restraints in all seating positions.

■ Adjusting the Front and Second Row Outer and Third Row 

Outer Head Restraints Positions

Head restraints are most effective for 
protection against whiplash and other rear-
impact crash injuries when the center of the 
back of the occupant’s head rests against the 
center of the restraint. The tops of the 
occupant’s ears should be level with the 
center height of the restraint.

Position head in the center 
of the head restraint.

1Head Restraints

3WARNING

Improperly positioning head restraints 
reduces their effectiveness and increases 
the likelihood of serious injury in a crash.

Make sure head restraints are in place and 
positioned properly before driving.

In order for the head restraint system to work 
properly:
• Do not hang any items on the head restraints, or 

from the restraint legs.

• Do not place any object between an occupant and 

the seat-back.

• Install each restraint in its proper location.

Maintain a Proper Sitting Position
After all occupants have adjusted their seats and head restraints, and put on their 
seat belts, it is very important that they continue to sit upright, well back in their 
seats, with their feet on the floor, until the vehicle is safely parked and the engine is 
off.

Sitting improperly can increase the chance of injury during a crash. For example, if 
an occupant slouches, lies down, turns sideways, sits forward, leans forward or 
sideways, or puts one or both feet up, the chance of injury during a crash is greatly 
increased.

In addition, an occupant who is out of position in the front seat can be seriously or 
fatally injured in a crash by striking interior parts of the vehicle or being struck by an 
inflating front airbag.

The SiriusXM® satellites are in orbit over the equator; 
therefore, objects south of the vehicle may cause 
satellite reception interruptions. Satellite signals are 
more likely to be blocked by tall buildings and 
mountains the farther north you travel from the

following circumstances:
• In a location with an obstruction to the south of 

your vehicle.

5. Unauthorized Use and Abuse. You are responsible for ensuring your (and any authorized third parties’) use of the SOFTWARE and 
SERVICES remains in compliance with this AGREEMENT and all other applicable HONDA TERMS and PROVIDER TERMS. You acknowledge 
and agree that any use of the SOFTWARE or SERVICES occurring through your VEHICLE will be deemed your actions and that HONDA and 
PROVIDERS may rely upon such actions. You agree to immediately notify us if you suspect fraudulent or abusive activity involving the 
SOFTWARE or SERVICES. If you so notify us or if we otherwise suspect fraudulent or abusive activity, you agree to cooperate with us in any 
fraud investigation and to use any fraud prevention measures we prescribe. Your failure to immediately notify us or cooperate to use such 
measures will result in your liability for all fraudulent usage or abusive activity associated with your VEHICLE.

6. SOFTWARE Updates. The SOFTWARE and SERVICES may be updated when your VEHICLE is serviced by a DEALER or remotely, over-the-
air, by HONDA from time to time; such updates may occur with or without further notice or your future consent. The SOFTWARE may be 
updated at HONDA’s discretion and for any purpose including, without limitation, to patch or otherwise improve the SOFTWARE or 
SERVICES functionality, security, or stability. All updates to the SOFTWARE and SERVICES are subject to this AGREEMENT and any other 
applicable HONDA TERMS and PROVIDER TERMS.

7. Uninstalling, Removing, and Replacing the SOFTWARE. Replacing SOFTWARE or HONDA SERVICES with software or firmware not 
provided and installed by HONDA or a DEALER will render all representations and warranties for the SOFTWARE, HONDA SERVICES, and 
VEHICLE functionality reliant upon the SOFTWARE or HONDA SERVICES null and void.

D. SOFTWARE Operational Notices and Warnings
1. Vehicle Geolocation Information. You acknowledge that your VEHICLE may be equipped with certain traffic and map features. The 
traffic feature will automatically collect and transmit, through GPS technology, your Vehicle’s current location (longitude and latitude), 
travel direction and speed (“VEHICLE GEOLOCATION INFORMATION”) to HONDA and PROVIDERS. The VEHICLE GEOLOCATION 
INFORMATION is used by HONDA and PROVIDERS to provide traffic and navigation-related information to you, but may also be used to 
provide other SERVICES or offers to you. HONDA will not use such VEHICLE GEOLOCATION INFORMATION for its own marketing efforts, 
or provide such information to unaffiliated third parties for their own purposes, without your express consent.

2. Potential Map Inaccuracy and Route Safety. Maps used by this system may be inaccurate because of changes in roads, traffic controls, 
routing, or driving conditions. Always use good judgment and common sense when following suggested routes. Do not follow the route 
suggestions if doing so would result in an unsafe or illegal driving maneuver, if you would be placed in an unsafe situation, or if you would 
be directed into an area that you consider unsafe. Do not rely on any navigation features included in the system to route you to emergency 
services. Not all emergency services such as police, fire stations, hospitals, or clinics are likely to be contained in the map database for such 
navigation features. Ask local authorities or an emergency services operator for such locations and routes. The driver is ultimately 
responsible for the safe operation of the vehicle and therefore, must evaluate whether it is safe to follow the suggested directions. Any 
navigation features are provided only as an aid. Make your driving decisions based on your observations of local conditions and existing 
traffic regulations. Navigation features are not a substitute for your personal judgment. Any route suggestions made by the SOFTWARE or 
SERVICES should never replace any local traffic regulations or your personal judgment or knowledge of safe driving practices.

3. Speech Recognition: You acknowledge and understand that HONDA and PROVIDERS may record, retain, and use voices commands 
when you use the speech recognition components of the SOFTWARE or SERVICES. You and all VEHICLE operators and passengers (a) 
consent to the recording and retention of voice commands in support of providing speech recognition components and (b) release HONDA 
and PROVIDERS from all claims, liabilities, and losses that may result from any use of such recorded voice commands. Recognition errors 
are inherent in speech recognition. It is your responsibility to monitor any speech recognition functions included in the system and address 
any errors. Neither HONDA nor PROVIDERS will be liable for any damages arising out of errors in the speech recognition process.

F
e
a
t
u
r

4. Distraction Hazards. Navigation features may require manual (non-verbal) input or setup. Attempting to perform such set-up or insert 
data while driving can seriously distract your attention and could cause a crash or other serious consequences; the ability to undertake such 
interactions may also be limited by state or local law, which laws you are responsible to know and follow. Even occasional short scans of 
the screen may be hazardous if your attention has been diverted away from your driving at a critical time. Pull over and stop the vehicle in 
a safe and legal manner before attempting to access a function of the system requiring prolonged attention. Do not raise the volume 
excessively. Keep the volume at a level where you can still hear outside traffic and emergency signals while driving. Driving while unable 
to hear these sounds could result in a crash.

E. Information Collection and Storage
1. Information Collection, Use, Transmission and Storage of Data. Consent to Use of Data: You agree that HONDA and PROVIDERS may 
collect and use your information gathered in any manner as part of product support services related to the SOFTWARE or related services. 
HONDA may share such information with third parties, including, without limitation, PROVIDERS, third party software and services 
suppliers, their affiliates and/or their designated agents, solely to improve their products or to provide services or technologies to you. 
HONDA, third party software and systems suppliers, their affiliates and/or their designated agent may disclose this information to others, 
but not in a form that personally identifies you.

2. Information Storage. Depending on the type of multimedia system you have in your VEHICLE, certain information may be stored for ease 
of use of the SOFTWARE including, without limitation, search history, location history in certain applications, previous and saved 
destinations, map locations within certain applications, and device numbers and contact information.

(a) Vehicle Health Information. Your VEHICLE may remotely transmit information regarding the status and health of your VEHICLE 
(“VEHICLE INFORMATION”) to HONDA without notification to you. VEHICLE INFORMATION may contain VEHICLE maintenance and 
malfunction status that is derived from VEHICLE diagnostic data and includes, but is not limited to, status of powered doors and windows, 
battery life data, battery charging data, VEHICLE speed, coolant temperature, air compressor revolution, output power, warning codes, 
diagnostic trouble codes, fuel injection volume, and engine rotations per minute. VEHICLE HEALTH INFORMATION may be used by HONDA 
for research and development, to deliver HONDA SERVICES and information to you, and to contact you, and is retained only for a period 
of time necessary to fulfill these goals.

(b) VEHICLE Geolocation Data (non-navigation/map based). If you opt-in to geolocation-based SERVICES, your vehicle’s geolocation data 
(latitude and longitude) will be automatically sent from your VEHICLE to HONDA and PROVIDERS.

(c) You understand that the inputting or uploading of information to your VEHICLE’s multimedia system or the SOFTWARE or SERVICES is 
at your own risk and that HONDA is not responsible for unauthorized access to or use of any personal or other information. All information 
uploaded to the SOFTWARE and SERVICES may be stored on your VEHICLES’s multimedia system and you understand that the security and 
safety of your VEHICLE’s multimedia system is your sole responsibility.

2. Limitation on HONDA and PROVIDER liability. Neither HONDA nor PROVIDERS will be liable to you or any other party for consequential, 
indirect, incidental, special, or punitive damages (including without limitation lost profits) in connection with your use of the SOFTWARE 
or SERVICES, even if HONDA or PROVIDERS are aware of the possibility of such damages. These limitations apply to all claims, including, 
without limitation, claims in contract and tort (such as negligence, product liability and strict liability). To the extent that a jurisdiction does 
not permit the exclusion or limitation of liability as set forth herein our liability is limited to the maximum extent permitted by law in such

HomeLink® Universal Transceiver *

The HomeLink® Universal Transceiver can be programmed to operate up to three 
remote controlled devices around your home, such as garage doors, lighting, or 
home security systems.

■ Important Safety Precautions
Refer to the safety information that came with your garage door opener to test that 
the safety features are functioning properly. If you do not have the safety 
information, contact the manufacturer.

Before programming HomeLink, make sure that people and objects are out of the 
way of the garage or gate to prevent potential injury or damage.

When programming a garage door opener, park just outside the garage door’s path.

1HomeLink® Universal Transceiver *

Before programming HomeLink to operate a garage 
door opener, confirm that the opener has an external 
entrapment protection system, such as an “electronic 
eye,” or other safety and reverse stop features. If it 
does not, HomeLink may not be able to operate it.

Before Driving

Driving Preparation
Check the following items before you start driving.

■ Exterior Checks
• Make sure there are no obstructions on the windows, door mirrors, exterior 

lights, or other parts of the vehicle.
u Remove any frost, snow, or ice.
u Remove any snow on the roof, as this can slip down and obstruct your field of 

vision while driving. If frozen solid, remove ice once it has softened.

u When removing ice from around the wheels, be sure not to damage the wheel 

or wheel components.

• Make sure the hood is securely closed.

u If the hood opens while driving, your front view will be blocked.

• Make sure the tires are in good condition.

u Check air pressures, and check for damage and excessive wear.

2 Checking and Maintaining Tires P. 675

• Make sure there are no people or objects behind or around the vehicle.

u There are blind spots from the inside.

1Exterior Checks

NOTICE
When doors are frozen shut, use warm water around 
the door edges to melt any ice. Do not try to force 
them open, as this can damage the rubber trim 
around the doors. When done, wipe dry to avoid 
further freezing.

Do not pour warm water into the key cylinder.
You will be unable to insert the key if the water 
freezes in the hole.

Heat from the engine and exhaust can ignite 
flammable materials left under the hood, causing a 
fire. If you’ve parked your vehicle for an extended 
period, inspect and remove any debris that may have 
collected, such as dried grass and leaves that have 
fallen or have been carried in for use as a nest by a 
small animal. Also check under the hood for leftover 
flammable materials after you or someone else has 
performed maintenance on your vehicle.

1Maximum Load Limit

3WARNING

Overloading or improper loading 
can affect handling and stability 
and cause a crash in which you 
can be hurt or killed.
Follow all load limits and other 
loading guidelines in this manual.

Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR):
The maximum allowable weight of the vehicle, all 
occupants, all accessories, all cargo, and the tongue 
load.

2 Specifications P. 740

This figure includes the total weight of all occupants, cargo, and 
accessories, and the tongue load if you are towing a trailer.

Gross Axle Weight Rating (GAWR):
The maximum allowable weight of the vehicle axle.

2 Specifications P. 740

Steps for Determining Correct Load Limit -
(1) Locate the statement “The combined weight of occupants and 

cargo should never exceed XXX kg or XXX lbs.” on your 
vehicle’s placard.

(2) Determine the combined weight of the driver and passengers 

that will be riding in your vehicle.

(3) Subtract the combined weight of the driver and passengers 

from XXX kg or XXX lbs.

(4) The resulting figure equals the available amount of cargo and 

luggage load capacity. For example, if the “XXX” amount 
equals 1,400 lbs. and there will be five 150 lb. passengers in 
your vehicle, the amount of available cargo and luggage load 
capacity is 650 lbs.
(1,400 - 750 (5 x 150) = 650 lbs.)

(5) Determine the combined weight of luggage and cargo being 
loaded on the vehicle. That weight may not safely exceed the 
available cargo and luggage load capacity calculated in step 4.
(6) If your vehicle will be towing a trailer, load from your trailer will 

be transferred to your vehicle. Consult this manual to 
determine how this reduces the available cargo and luggage 
load capacity of your vehicle.

3WARNING

Exceeding any load limit or improperly 
loading your vehicle and trailer can cause a 
crash in which you can be seriously hurt or 
killed.

Check the loading of your vehicle and 
trailer carefully before starting to drive.

Check if all loads are within limits at a public scale.
If a public scale is not available, add the estimated 
weight of your cargo load to the weight of your 
trailer (as quoted by the manufacturer), and then 
measure the tongue load with an appropriate scale or 
tongue gauge or estimate it based on cargo 
distribution. Refer to the trailer owner’s manual for 
additional information.

Break-in Period
Avoid towing a trailer during your vehicle’s first 600 
miles (1,000 km).

Never exceed the gross weight ratings.

■ Tongue load
The weight of the tongue with a fully loaded 
trailer on the hitch should be approximately 
10% of the total trailer weight.

Tongue Load
Tongue Load

• Excessive tongue load reduces front tire traction and steering control. Too little 

tongue load can make the trailer unstable and cause it to sway.

■ Towing Equipment and Accessories
Towing equipment varies by the size of your trailer, how much load you are towing, 
and where you are towing.

1Towing Equipment and Accessories

Make sure that all equipment is properly installed and 
maintained, and that it meets federal, state, province/
territory, and local regulations.

■ Hitches
The hitch must be of an approved type and properly bolted to the underbody.

■ Weight distribution hitches
Your vehicle is designed to tow without the need for a load distributing hitch. If you 
wish to use one, please consult your trailer maker for proper installation and set-up.
Improper set-up could degrade the handling, stability, and braking performance of 
your vehicle.

Consult your trailer maker for proper installation and 
setup of the equipment.
Improper installation and setup can affect the 
handling, stability, and braking performance of your 
vehicle.

Consult your trailer sales or rental agency if any other 
items are recommended or required for your towing 
situation.

The lighting and wiring of trailers can vary by type 
and brand. If a connector is required, it should only 
be installed by a qualified technician.

uuTowing a TraileruTowing Preparation

■ Safety chains
Always use safety chains when you tow a trailer. Leave enough slack to allow the 
trailer to turn corners easily, but do not allow the chains to drag on the ground.

■ Trailer brakes
Recommended for any trailer with a total weight of 1,000 lbs (450 kg) or more:
There are two common types of trailer brakes: surge and electric. Surge brakes are 
common for boat trailers, since the brakes will get wet. If you choose electric brakes, 
be sure they are electronically actuated. Do not attempt to attach trailer brakes to 
your vehicle’s hydraulic system, as it will lower braking effectiveness and create a 
potential hazard.

1Towing Equipment and Accessories
Trailer packages and products:
• Ball mount, hitch plug, hitch pin etc.
• Wiring harness kit
• Trailer hitch kit
Are available at a dealer.

■ Trailer light
Trailer lights and equipment must comply with federal, state, province/territory, and 
local regulations. Check with your local trailer sales or rental agency for the 
requirements in the area where you plan to tow.

1Trailer light

+B Small 
Light

We recommend that you have a dealer install 
a Honda wiring harness and converter. They

Even if you are planning to use the non-Honda trailer 
lighting harness and converter, ask a dealer for the 
correct connector and pins.

■ Sway control
This device can be used if your trailer tends to sway. Your trailer maker can tell you 
what kind of sway control you need and how to install it. Improper installation could 
degrade the handling and stability of your vehicle.

■ Trailer mirrors
Many states, provinces and territories require special exterior mirrors when towing a 
trailer. Install special mirrors whenever you cannot clearly see behind you, or if the 
trailer creates a blind spot.

Driving Safely with a Trailer
■ Things You Need To Know Before Towing a Trailer
• Have the trailer properly serviced and keep it in good condition.
• Make sure that all the weights and load in the vehicle and trailer are within limits.

2 Towing Load Limits P. 532

• Securely attach the hitch, safety chains, and other necessary parts to the trailer.
• Securely store all the items in and on the trailer so that they do not shift while 

driving.

• Check if the lights and brakes on the trailer are working properly.
• Check the pressure of the trailer tires, including the spare.
Models with Auto Idle Stop
• Turn off the Auto Idle Stop system using the Auto Idle Stop OFF button. The 
trailer weight can affect your vehicle’s brake effectiveness if Auto Idle Stop is 
activated on a hill while towing a trailer.

D
r
i
v
i
n
g

■ Towing Speeds and Gears
• Drive slower than normal.
• Obey posted speed limits for vehicles with trailers.
• Use the (D position when towing a trailer on level roads.

■ Turning and Braking
• Turn more slowly and with a wider turning arc than normal.
• Allow more time and distance for braking.
• Do not brake or turn suddenly.

536

1Driving Safely with a Trailer

Operating speed when towing a trailer must not 
exceed 62 mph (100 km/h).

Parking
In addition to the normal precautions, place wheel 
chocks at each of the trailer’s tires.

Remember to unhitch the trailer before changing a 
flat tire. Ask the trailer sales or rental agency where 
and how to store the trailer’s spare tire.

1Towing Speeds and Gears

When towing a fixed-sided trailer (e.g., camper), do 
not exceed 55 mph (88 km/h). At higher speeds, the 
trailer may sway or affect vehicle handling.

meters).

When starting the engine in cold weather, turn off all 
electrical accessories such as the lights, climate 
control system, and rear defogger in order to reduce 
battery drain.

If you live in a region where winter is extremely cold, 
an engine block heater will improve starting and 
warming of the engine. Consult a dealer for details.

If the exhaust system sounds abnormal or you can 
smell exhaust gas inside the vehicle, have your vehicle 
checked by a dealer. There may be a problem with 
the engine or exhaust system.

Bring the remote close to the ENGINE START/STOP 
button if the battery in the remote is weak.

uuWhen DrivinguPrecautions While Driving

Precautions While Driving
■ In Rain
Avoid driving in deep water and on flooded roads. This can damage the engine or 
driveline, or cause electrical component failure.

■ Other Precautions
If there is a strong impact with something under the vehicle, stop in a safe location. 
Check the underside of the vehicle for damage or any fluid leaks.

1Precautions While Driving

NOTICE
Do not change the gear position while pressing the 
accelerator pedal. You could damage the 
transmission.

NOTICE
If you repeatedly turn the steering wheel at an 
extremely low speed, or hold the steering wheel in 
the full left or right position for a while, the electric 
power steering (EPS) system heats up. The system 
goes into a protective mode, and limits its 
performance. The steering wheel becomes harder 
and harder to operate. Once the system cools down, 
the EPS system is restored.
Repeated operation under these conditions can 
eventually damage the system.

If the power mode is set to ACCESSORY while 
driving, the engine will shut down and all steering 
and brake power assist functions will stop, making it 
difficult to control the vehicle.

Do not change the gear position to (N, as you will 
lose engine braking (and acceleration) performance.

During the first 600 miles (1,000 km) of operation, 
avoid sudden acceleration or full throttle operation so 
as not to damage the engine or powertrain.

Avoid hard braking for the first 200 miles (300 km). 
You should also follow this when the brake pads are 
replaced.

19 ODYSSEY-31THR6100.book  545 ページ  ２０１８年３月１２日　月曜日　午後７時３３分

Automatic Transmission
■ Creeping
The engine runs at a higher idle speed and creeping increases.
Keep the brake pedal firmly depressed when stopped.

■ Kickdown
Quickly depressing the accelerator pedal while driving uphill may cause the 
transmission to drop to a lower gear, unexpectedly increasing vehicle speed. Depress 
the accelerator pedal carefully, especially on slippery roads and curves.

Front Sensor Camera*
The camera, used in systems such as LKAS, RDM, ACC, and CMBSTM, is designed to 
detect an object that triggers any of the systems to operate its functions.

1Front Sensor Camera*

■ Camera Location and Handling Tips

Front Sensor 
Camera

This camera is located behind the rearview 
mirror.

To help reduce the likelihood that high interior 
temperatures will cause the camera’s sensing 
system to shut off, when parking, find a shady 
area or face the front of the vehicle away from 
the sun. If you use a reflective sun shade, do 
not allow it to cover the camera housing.
Covering the camera can concentrate heat on 
it.

D
r
i
v
i
n
g

Never apply a film or attach any objects to the 
windshield, the hood, or the front grill that could 
obstruct the camera’s field of vision and cause the 
system to operate abnormally.
Scratches, nicks, and other damage to the windshield 
within the camera’s field of vision can cause the 
system to operate abnormally. If this occurs, we 
recommend that you replace the windshield with a 
genuine Honda replacement windshield. Making 
even minor repairs within the camera’s field of vision 
or installing an aftermarket replacement windshield 
may also cause the system to operate abnormally.
After replacing the windshield, have a dealer 
recalibrate the camera. Proper calibration of the 
camera is necessary for the system to operate 
properly.

Do not place an object on the top of the instrument 
panel. It may reflect onto the windshield and prevent 
the system from detecting lane lines properly.

uuWhen DrivinguRoad Departure Mitigation (RDM) System*

Road Departure Mitigation (RDM) System *
Alerts and helps to assist you when the system detects a possibility of your vehicle 
unintentionally crossing over detected lane markings and/or leaving the roadway 
altogether.

■ How the System Works

1Road Departure Mitigation (RDM) System*

Important Safety Reminder
Like all assistance systems, the RDM system has 
limitations.
Over-reliance on the RDM system may result in a 
collision. It is always your responsibility to keep the 
vehicle within your driving lane.

The RDM system only alerts you when lane drift is 
detected without a turn signal in use. The RDM 
system may not detect all lane markings or lane or 
roadway departures; accuracy will vary based on 
weather, speed and lane marker condition. It is 
always your responsibility to safely operate the 
vehicle and avoid collisions.

You can read about handling information for the 
camera equipped with this system.

2 Front Sensor Camera* P. 564

The RDM system may not work properly or may work 
improperly under the certain conditions:

2 RDM Conditions and Limitations P. 581

There are times when you may not notice RDM 
functions due to your operation of the vehicle, or 
road surface conditions.

The front camera behind the rearview mirror 
monitors left and right lane markings (in white 
or yellow). If your vehicle is getting too close 
to detected lane markings without a turn 
signal activated, the system, in addition to a 
visual alert, applies steering torque and alerts 
you with rapid vibrations on the steering 
wheel, to help you remain within the detected 
lane.

2 Customized Features P. 443

As a visual alert, the Lane Departure 
message appears on the driver information 
interface.

If the system determines that its steering input 
is insufficient to keep your vehicle on the 
roadway, it may apply braking.

u Braking is applied only when the lane 

markings are solid continuous lines.

Vehicle Stability Assist® (VSA®), aka Electronic 
Stability Control (ESC), System
VSA® helps to stabilize the vehicle during cornering if the vehicle turns more or less 
than what was intended. It also assists in maintaining traction on slippery surfaces. 
It does so by regulating engine output and selectively applying the brakes.

■ VSA® Operation

VSA® System 
Indicator

When VSA® activates, you may notice that the 
engine does not respond to the accelerator. 
You may also notice some noise from the 
hydraulic system. You will also see the 
indicator blink.

1Vehicle Stability Assist® (VSA®), aka Electronic Stability Control 

(ESC), System
The VSA® may not function properly if tire type and 
size are mixed. Make sure to use the same size and 
type of tire, and the air pressures as specified.

When the VSA® system indicator comes on and stays 
on while driving, there may be a problem with the 
system. While this may not interfere with normal 
driving, have your vehicle checked by a dealer 
immediately.

VSA® cannot enhance stability in all driving situations 
and does not control the entire braking system. You 
still need to drive and corner at speeds appropriate 
for the conditions and always leave a sufficient 
margin of safety.

The main function of the VSA® system is generally 
known as Electronic Stability Control (ESC). The 
system also includes a traction control function.

uuWhen DrivinguTire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) - Required Federal Explanation

Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) - Required 
Federal Explanation
Each tire, including the spare (if provided), should be checked 
monthly when cold and inflated to the inflation pressure 
recommended by the vehicle manufacturer on the vehicle placard 
or tire inflation pressure label.

(If your vehicle has tires of a different size than the size indicated 
on the vehicle placard or tire inflation pressure label, you should 
determine the proper tire inflation pressure for those tires.)

As an added safety feature, your vehicle has been equipped with 
a tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) that illuminates a low 
tire pressure telltale 

when one or more of your tires is significantly under-inflated.

Accordingly, when the low tire pressure telltale illuminates, you 
should stop and check your tires as soon as possible, and inflate 
them to the proper pressure.

Driving on a significantly under-inflated tire causes the tire to 
overheat and can lead to tire failure. Under-inflation also reduces 
fuel efficiency and tire tread life, and may affect the vehicle’s 
handling and stopping ability.

uuWhen DrivinguTire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) - Required Federal Explanation

Please note that the TPMS is not a substitute for proper tire 
maintenance, and it is the driver’s responsibility to maintain 
correct tire pressure, even if under-inflation has not reached the 
level to trigger illumination of the TPMS low tire pressure telltale.

Your vehicle has also been equipped with a TPMS malfunction 
indicator to indicate when the system is not operating properly. 
The TPMS malfunction indicator is combined with the low tire 
pressure telltale. When the system detects a malfunction, the 
telltale will flash for approximately one minute and then remain 
continuously illuminated. This sequence will continue upon 
subsequent vehicle start-ups as long as the malfunction exists.

When the malfunction indicator is illuminated, the system may 
not be able to detect or signal low tire pressure as intended.

TPMS malfunctions may occur for a variety of reasons, including 
the installation of replacement or alternate tires or wheels on the 
vehicle that prevent the TPMS from functioning properly.

Always check the TPMS malfunction telltale after replacing one or 
more tires or wheels on your vehicle to ensure that the 
replacement or alternate tires and wheels allow the TPMS to 
continue to function properly.

a crash and serious injury or death.
Do not rely only on the blind spot 
information system when changing lanes.
Always look in your mirrors, to either side 
of your vehicle, and behind you for other 
vehicles before changing lanes.

Important Safety Reminder
Like all assistance systems, blind spot information 
system has limitations. Over reliance on the blind spot 
information system may result in a collision.

The system is for your convenience only. Even if an object is 
within the alert zone, the following situations may occur.
• The blind spot information system alert indicator 

may not come on due to obstruction (splashes, 
etc.) even without the Blind Spot Info Not 
Available driver information interface appearing.
• The blind spot information system alert indicator 
may come on even with the message appearing.

The blind spot information system alert indicator may 
not come on under the following conditions:
• A vehicle does not stay in the alert zone for more 

than two seconds.

• A vehicle is parked in a side lane.
• The speed difference between your vehicle and the 

vehicle you are passing is greater than 6 mph (10 km/h).

• An object not detected by the radar sensors 

approaches or passes your vehicle.

• A vehicle running in the adjacent lane is a 

motorcycle or other small vehicle.

LaneWatchTM*
LaneWatch is an assistance system that allows you to check the passenger side rear 
areas displayed on the audio/information screen when the turn signal is activated to 
the passenger’s side. A camera in the passenger side door mirror monitors these 
areas and allows you to check for vehicles, in addition to your visual check and use 
of the passenger door mirror. You can also keep the system on for your convenience 
while driving.

3WARNING

Failure to visually confirm that it is safe to 
change lanes before doing so may result in 
a crash and serious injury or death.

Do not rely only on LaneWatch while 
driving.

Always look in your mirrors, to either side 
of your vehicle, and behind you for other 
vehicles before changing lanes.

Important Safety Reminder
Like all assistance systems, LaneWatch has 
limitations. Over reliance on LaneWatch may result in 
a collision.

The LaneWatch function can be affected by weather, 
lighting (including headlights and low sun angle), 
ambient darkness, camera condition, and loading.

The LaneWatch may not provide the intended display 
of traffic to the side and rear under the following 
conditions:
• Your vehicle’s suspension has been altered, 

changing the height of the vehicle.

• Your tires are over or under inflated.
• Your tires or wheels are of varied size or 

construction.

1

Three lines that appear on the screen can give 
an idea of how far the vehicles or objects on 
the screen are from your vehicle, respectively. 
If an object is near line 1 (in red), it indicates 
that it is close to your vehicle whereas an 
object near line 3 farther away.

* Not available on all models

uuWhen DrivinguLaneWatchTM*

The LaneWatch camera view is restricted. Its unique 
lens makes objects on the screen slightly look 
different from what they are.

LaneWatch display does not come on when the 
transmission is in (R.

For proper LaneWatch operation:
• The camera is located in the passenger side door 
mirror. Always keep this area clean. If the camera 
lens is covered with dirt or moisture, use a soft, 
moist cloth to keep the lens clean and free of 
debris.

• Do not cover the camera lens with labels or stickers 

of any kind.

• Do not touch the camera lens.

1Reference Lines

The area around the reference line 1 (red) is very close 
to your vehicle. As always, make sure to visually 
confirm the safety of a lane change before changing 
lanes.

The distance between your vehicle and lines 1, 2 and 
3 on the screen vary depending on road conditions 
and vehicle loading. For example, the reference lines 
on the screen may seem to appear closer than the 
actual distances when the rear of your vehicle is more 
heavily loaded.

Consult a dealer if:
• The passenger side door mirror, or area around it is 

severely impacted, resulting in changing the 
camera angle.

• The LaneWatch display does not come on at all.

■ Foot Brake
Your vehicle is equipped with disc brakes at all four wheels. A vacuum power assist 
helps reduce the effort needed on the brake pedal. The brake assist system increases 
the stopping force when you depress the brake pedal hard in an emergency 
situation. The anti-lock brake system (ABS) helps you retain steering control when 
braking very hard.

uuBrakinguBrake System

1Foot Brake

Check the brakes after driving through deep water, 
or if there is a buildup of road surface water. If 
necessary, dry the brakes by lightly depressing the 
pedal several times.

If you hear a continuous metallic friction sound when 
applying the brakes, this is caused by the brake wear 
indicator rubbing on the brake rotor and indicates 
that the brake pads need to be replaced. Have the 
vehicle checked by a dealer. If you hear only an 
occasional squeak or squeal when you initially apply 
the brake pedal, this may be normal and caused by 
high frequency vibration of the brake pads against 
the rotating brake disc.

Constantly using the brake pedal while going down a 
long hill builds up heat, which reduces the brake 
effectiveness. Apply engine braking by taking your 
foot off the accelerator pedal and downshifting to a 
lower gear.

Do not rest your foot on the brake pedal while 
driving, as it will lightly apply the brakes and cause 
them to lose effectiveness over time and reduce pad 
life. It will also confuse drivers behind you.

uuBrakinguAnti-lock Brake System (ABS)

Anti-lock Brake System (ABS)
■ ABS
Helps prevent the wheels from locking up, and helps you retain steering control by 
pumping the brakes rapidly, much faster than you.

The electronic brake distribution (EBD) system, which is part of the ABS, also 
balances the front-to-rear braking distribution according to vehicle loading.

You should never pump the brake pedal. Let the ABS work for you by always 
keeping firm, steady pressure on the brake pedal. This is sometimes referred to as 
“stomp and steer.”

■ ABS operation
The brake pedal may pulsate slightly when the ABS is working. Keep holding the 
pedal firmly down. On dry pavement, you will need to press on the brake pedal very 
hard before the ABS activates. However, you may feel the ABS activate immediately 
if you are trying to stop on snow or ice.

ABS may activate when you depress the brake pedal when driving on:
• Wet or snow covered roads.
• Roads paved with stone.
• Roads with uneven surfaces, such as potholes, cracks, manholes, etc.

When the vehicle speed goes under 6 mph (10 km/h), the ABS stops.

1Anti-lock Brake System (ABS)

NOTICE
The ABS may not function correctly if you use a tire of 
the wrong size or type.

If the ABS indicator comes on while driving, there 
may be a problem with the system. While normal 
braking will not be affected, there is a possibility that 
the ABS will not operating. Have your vehicle 
checked by a dealer immediately.

The ABS is not designed for the purpose of reducing 
the time or distance it takes for a vehicle to stop: It is 
designed to limit brake lockup which can lead to 
skidding and loss of steering control.

In the following cases, your vehicle may need more 
distance to stop than a vehicle without the ABS:
• You are driving on rough or uneven road surfaces, 

such as gravel or snow.

• The tires are equipped with snow chains.

The following may be observed with the ABS system:
• Motor sounds coming from the engine 

compartment when the brakes are applied, or 
when system checks are being performed after the 
engine has been started and while the vehicle 
accelerates.

• Brake pedal and/or the vehicle body vibration when 

ABS activates.

These vibrations and sounds are normal to ABS 
systems and are no cause for concern.

Collision Mitigation Braking SystemTM (CMBSTM)*
Can assist you when there is a possibility of your vehicle colliding with a vehicle or a 
pedestrian detected in front of yours. The CMBSTM is designed to alert you when a 
potential collision is determined, as well as to reduce your vehicle speed to help 
minimize collision severity when a collision is deemed unavoidable.

The radar sensor is 
in the front grille.

The system starts monitoring the roadway ahead when your vehicle speed is about 
3 mph (5 km/h) and there is a vehicle in front of you.
The CMBSTM activates when:
● The speed difference between your vehicle and a vehicle or pedestrian detected 

in front of you becomes about 3 mph (5 km/h) and over with a chance of a 
collision.

● Your vehicle speed is about 62 mph (100 km/h) or less and there is a chance of a 

collision with an oncoming detected vehicle or a pedestrian in front of you.

1Collision Mitigation Braking SystemTM (CMBSTM)*

Important Safety Reminder
The CMBSTM is designed to reduce the severity of an 
unavoidable collision. It does not prevent a collision 
nor stop the vehicle automatically. It is still your 
responsibility to operate the brake pedal and steering 
wheel appropriately according to the driving 
conditions.

The CMBSTM may not activate or may not detect a 
vehicle in front of your vehicle under certain 
conditions:

1How the system works

Rapid vibrations on the steering wheel alert you 
when the your vehicle speed is between 19 and 62 
mph (30 and 100 km/h) with an oncoming vehicle 
detected in front of you.

When the CMBSTM activates, it may automatically 
apply the brake. It will be canceled when your vehicle 
stops or a potential collision is not determined.

Radar sensors: 
Underneath the rear bumper 
corners

When a vehicle is detected approaching from a rear corner, Cross Traffic Monitor 
alerts you with a buzzer and a displayed warning.

The system will not detect a vehicle that approaches from directly behind your 
vehicle, nor will it provide alerts about a detected vehicle when it moves directly 
behind your vehicle.

The system does not provide alerts for a vehicle that is moving away from your 
vehicle, and it may not detect or alert for pedestrians, bicycles, or stationary objects.

uuParking Your VehicleuCross Traffic Monitor *

Cross Traffic Monitor may not detect or may delay 
alerting an approaching vehicle, or may alert without 
an approaching vehicle under the following 
conditions:
• An obstacle, such as another vehicle and a wall, 
near your vehicle’s rear bumper, is blocking the 
radar sensor’s scope.

• Your vehicle is moving at the speed of about 3 mph 

(5 km/h) or higher.

• A vehicle is approaching at the speed other than 
between about 6 and 16 mph (10 and 25 km/h).
• The system picks up external interference such as 
other radar sensors from another vehicle or strong 
radio wave transmitted from a facility nearby.

• Either corner of the rear bumper is covered with 

snow, ice, mud or dirt.

• When there is bad weather.
• Your vehicle is on an incline.
• Your vehicle is tilted due to a heavy load in the rear.
• Your vehicle is reversing towards a wall, a pole, a 

vehicle, and so on.

• The rear bumper or the sensors have been 

improperly repaired or the rear bumper has been 
deformed. Have your vehicle checked by a dealer.

For proper operation, always keep the rear bumper 
corner area clean.
Do not cover the rear bumper corner area with labels 
or stickers of any kind.

1About Your Multi-View Rear Camera

The rear camera view is restricted. You cannot see 
the corner ends of the bumper or what is underneath 
the bumper. Its unique lens also makes objects 
appear closer or farther than they actually are.

Visually confirm that it is safe to drive before backing 
up. Certain conditions (such as weather, lighting, and 
high temperatures) may also restrict the rear view. Do 
not rely on the rearview display which does not give 
you all information about conditions at the back of 
your vehicle.

If the camera lens is covered with dirt or moisture, 
use a soft, moist cloth to keep the lens clean and free 
of debris.

Refueling

Fuel Information
■ Fuel recommendation
Unleaded gasoline, pump octane number 87 or higher
Use of a lower octane gasoline can cause a persistent, heavy metallic knocking noise 
that can lead to engine damage.

■ Top tier detergent gasoline
Because the level of detergency and additives in gasoline vary in the market, Honda 
endorses the use of “TOP TIER Detergent Gasoline” where available to help 
maintain the performance and reliability of your vehicle. TOP TIER Detergent 
Gasoline meets a new gasoline standard jointly established by leading automotive 
manufacturers to meet the needs of today’s advanced engines.

Qualifying gasoline retailers will, in most cases, identify their gasoline as having met 
“TOP TIER Detergent Gasoline” standards at the retail location. This fuel is 
guaranteed to contain the proper level of detergent additives and be free of metallic 
additives. The proper level of detergent additives, and absence of harmful metallic 
additives in gasoline, help avoid build-up of deposits in your engine and emission 
control system. 
For further important fuel-related information for your vehicle, or on information on 
gasoline that does not contain MMT, visit www.hondacars.com. In Canada, visit 
www.honda.ca for additional information on gasoline. For more information on top 
tier gasoline, visit www.toptiergas.com.

1Fuel Information

NOTICE
We recommend quality gasoline containing 
detergent additives that help prevent fuel system and 
engine deposits. In addition, in order to maintain 
good performance, fuel economy, and emissions 
control, we strongly recommend the use of gasoline 
that does NOT contain harmful manganese-based 
fuel additives such as MMT, if such gasoline is 
available.

Use of gasoline with these additives may adversely 
affect performance, and cause the malfunction 
indicator lamp on your instrument panel to come on. 
If this happens, contact a dealer for service.
Some gasoline today is blended with oxygenates such 
as ethanol. Your vehicle is designed to operate on 
oxygenated gasoline containing up to 15% ethanol 
by volume. Do not use gasoline containing methanol. 
If you notice any undesirable operating symptoms, try 
another service station or switch to another brand of 
gasoline.

How to Refuel
Your fuel tank is not equipped with a fuel filler cap. You can insert the filler nozzle 
directly into the filler neck. The tank seals itself again when you pull out the filler 
nozzle.

1How to Refuel

Press

1. Stop your vehicle with the service station 
pump on the left side of the vehicle in the 
rear.

2. Turn off the engine.
3. Unlock the driver’s door using the master 

door lock switch.
u The fuel fill door on the outer side of the 

vehicle will unlock.

the Inside P. 154

4. Press firmly and then release the area 

indicated by the arrow to release the fuel 
filler door.

uuRefuelinguHow to Refuel

3WARNING

Gasoline is highly flammable and explosive. 
You can be burned or seriously injured 
when handling fuel.

• Stop the engine, and keep heat, sparks, 

and flame away.

• Handle fuel only outdoors.
• Wipe up spills immediately.

The fuel filler opening is designed to accept only 
service station filler nozzles for refueling. Use of 
smaller diameter tubes (e.g., those used to siphon 
fuel for other uses) or other non-service station 
devices can damage the area in and around the filler 
opening.

D

The filler nozzle automatically stops to leave space in 
the fuel tank so that fuel does not overflow as a result 
of changes in air temperature.

If the filler nozzle keeps turning off when the tank is 
not full, there may be a problem with the pump’s fuel 
vapor recovery system. Try filling at another pump. If 
this does not fix the problem, consult a dealer.

lower part of filler opening, then insert it 
slowly and fully.
u Make sure that the end of the filler 

nozzle goes down along with the filler 
pipe.

u Keep the filler nozzle level.
u When the tank is full, the filler nozzle will 

click off automatically.

u After filling, wait about five seconds 

before removing the filler nozzle.

6. Shut the fuel fill door by hand.

Use the lock tab or the master door lock switch to 
unlock the fuel fill door.
The vehicle doors and fuel fill door automatically 
relock if the remote unlock function is used. This can 
be deactivated by briefly opening then closing the 
driver’s door.

Do not continue to add fuel after the filler nozzle has 
automatically stopped. Additional fuel can exceed 
the full tank capacity.

If you have to refuel your vehicle from a portable 
container, use the funnel provided with your vehicle.

Fuel Economy and CO2 Emissions
Improving Fuel Economy and Reducing CO2 
Emissions
Achieving fuel economy and reducing CO2 emissions is dependent on several 
factors, including driving conditions, load weight, idling time, driving habits, and 
vehicle condition. Depending on these and other factors, you may not achieve the 
rated fuel economy of this vehicle.

■ Maintenance and Fuel Economy
You can optimize your fuel economy with proper maintenance of your vehicle. 
Always maintain your vehicle in accordance with the messages displayed on the 
driver information interface.
• Use engine oil with the viscosity recommended.

2 Recommended Engine Oil P. 650
• Maintain the specified tire pressure.
• Do not load the vehicle with excess cargo.
• Keep your vehicle clean. A buildup of snow or mud on your vehicle’s underside 

adds weight and increases wind resistance.

Engine Oil Additives
Your vehicle does not require oil additives. In fact, 
they may adversely affect the engine performance 
and durability.

Oil is a major contributor to your engine’s 
performance and longevity. If you drive the 
vehicle with insufficient or deteriorated oil, 
the engine may fail or be damaged.

This seal indicates the oil is energy conserving 
and that it meets the American Petroleum 
Institute’s latest requirements.

Use a Genuine Honda Motor Oil or another 
commercial engine oil of suitable viscosity for 
the ambient temperature as shown.

This coolant is premixed with 50% antifreeze and 50% water. Do not add any 
straight antifreeze or water.

We recommend you check the engine coolant level every time you refuel. Check the

mark, add the specified coolant until it 
reaches the MAX mark.

3. Inspect the cooling system for leaks.

uuMaintenance Under the HooduEngine Coolant

3WARNING

Removing the radiator cap while the 
engine is hot can cause the coolant to spray 
out, seriously scalding you.

Always let the engine and radiator cool 
down before removing the radiator cap.

NOTICE
Genuine Honda engine coolant is a 50/50 mixture of 
antifreeze and water that can withstand freezing at 
temperatures as low as about -31°F (-35°C). If your 
vehicle is consistently subjected to temperatures 
below this, the concentration of antifreeze in the 
coolant should be increased. Consult a dealer for 
details.

If Honda antifreeze/coolant is not available, you may 
use another major brand of non-silicate coolant as a 
temporary replacement. Check that it is a high quality 
coolant recommended for aluminum engines. 
Continued use of any non-Honda coolant can result 
in corrosion, causing the cooling system to 
malfunction or fail. Have the cooling system flushed 
and refilled with Honda antifreeze/coolant as soon as 
possible.

Do not add rust inhibitors or other additives to your 
vehicle’s cooling system. They may not be compatible 
with the coolant or with the engine components.

Checking and Maintaining Tires

Checking Tires
To safely operate your vehicle, your tires must be of the proper type and size, in 
good condition with adequate tread, and properly inflated.

1Checking Tires

■ Inflation guidelines
Properly inflated tires provide the best combination of handling, tread life, and 
comfort. Refer to the driver’s doorjamb label or specifications page for the specified 
pressure.

Underinflated tires wear unevenly, adversely affect handling and fuel economy, and 
are more likely to fail from overheating.

Overinflated tires make your vehicle ride harshly, are more prone to road hazards, 
and wear unevenly.

Every day before you drive, look at each of the tires. If one looks lower than the 
others, check the pressure with a tire gauge.

At least once a month or before long trips, use a gauge to measure the pressure in 
all tires, including the spare. Even tires in good condition can lose 1-2 psi (10-20 kPa, 
0.1-0.2 kgf/cm2) per month.

■ Inspection guidelines
Every time you check inflation, also examine the tires and valve stems. Look for:
• Bumps or bulges on the side or in the tread. Replace the tire if you find any cuts, 

splits, or cracks in the side of the tire. Replace it if you see fabric or cord.

• Remove any foreign objects and inspect for air leaks.
• Uneven tread wear. Have a dealer check the wheel alignment.
• Excessive tread wear.

2 Wear Indicators P. 680

• Cracks or other damage around valve stem.

3WARNING

Using tires that are excessively worn or 
improperly inflated can cause a crash in 
which you can be seriously hurt or killed.

Follow all instructions in this owner’s 
manual regarding tire inflation and 
maintenance.

Measure the air pressure when tires are cold. This 
means the vehicle has been parked for at least three 
hours, or driven less than 1 mile (1.6 km). If 
necessary, add or release air until the specified 
pressure is reached.

If checked when hot, tire pressure can be as much as 
4–6 psi (30–40 kPa, 0.3–0.4 kgf/cm2) higher than if 
checked when cold.

Have a dealer check the tires if you feel a consistent 
vibration while driving. New tires and any that have 
been removed and reinstalled should be properly 
balanced.

Check the spare tire pressure once a month or before 
long trips.

uuChecking and Maintaining TiresuDOT Tire Quality Grading (U.S. Vehicles)

DOT Tire Quality Grading (U.S. Vehicles)
The tires on your vehicle meet all U.S. Federal Safety 
Requirements. All tires are also graded for treadwear, traction, 
and temperature performance according to Department of 
Transportation (DOT) standards. The following explains these 
gradings.

■ Uniform Tire Quality Grading
Quality grades can be found where applicable on the tire sidewall 
between tread shoulder and maximum section width.

■ Treadwear
The treadwear grade is a comparative rating based on the wear 
rate of the tire when tested under controlled conditions on a 
specified government test course. For example, a tire graded 150 
would wear one and one-half (1 1/2) times as well on the 
government course as a tire graded 100. The relative performance 
of tires depends upon the actual conditions of their use, however, 
and may depart significantly from the norm due to variations in 
driving habits, service practices and differences in road 
characteristics and climate.

uuChecking and Maintaining TiresuDOT Tire Quality Grading (U.S. Vehicles)

■ Traction
The traction grades, from highest to lowest, are AA, A, B, and C. 
Those grades represent the tire’s ability to stop on wet pavement 
as measured under controlled conditions on specified 
government test surfaces of asphalt and concrete. A tire marked 
C may have poor traction performance.

1Traction

Warning: The traction grade 
assigned to this tire is based on 
straight-ahead braking traction tests, 
and does not include acceleration, 
cornering, hydroplaning, or peak 
traction characteristics.

■ Temperature
The temperature grades are A (the highest), B, and C, 
representing the tire’s resistance to the generation of heat and its 
ability to dissipate heat when tested under controlled conditions 
on a specified indoor laboratory test wheel. Sustained high 
temperature can cause the material of the tire to degenerate and 
reduce tire life, and excessive temperature can lead to sudden tire 
failure. The grade C corresponds to a level of performance which 
all passenger car tires must meet under the Federal Motor Vehicle 
Safety Standard No. 109. Grades B and A represent higher levels 
of performance on the laboratory test wheel than the minimum 
required by law.

1Temperature

Warning: The temperature grade for 
this tire is established for a tire that is 
properly inflated and not 
overloaded. Excessive speed, 
underinflation, or excessive loading, 
either separately or in combination, 
can cause heat buildup and possible 
tire failure.

uuChecking and Maintaining TiresuWear Indicators

Wear Indicators

Example of a Wear 
Indicator mark

The groove where the wear indicator is 
located is 1/16 inch (1.6 mm) shallower than 
elsewhere on the tire. If the tread has worn so 
that the indicator is exposed, replace the tire. 
Worn out tires have poor traction on wet 
roads.

Tire Service Life
The life of your tires is dependent on many factors, including driving habits, road 
conditions, vehicle loading, inflation pressure, maintenance history, speed, and 
environmental conditions (even when the tires are not in use).

In addition to regular inspections and inflation pressure maintenance, it is 
recommended that you have annual inspections performed once the tires reach five 
years old. All tires, including the spare, should be removed from service after 10 
years from the date of manufacture, regardless of their condition or state of wear.

Tire and Wheel Replacement
Replace your tires with radials of the same size, load range, speed rating, and 
maximum cold tire pressure rating (as shown on the tire’s sidewall). Using tires of a 
different size or construction can cause certain vehicle systems such as the ABS and 
Vehicle Stability Assist® (VSA®) system to work incorrectly.

It is best to replace all four tires at the same time. If that isn’t possible, replace the 
front or rear tires in pairs.

1Tire and Wheel Replacement

3WARNING

Installing improper tires on your vehicle can 
affect handling and stability. This can cause 
a crash in which you can be seriously hurt or 
killed.

If you replace a wheel, only use TPMS specified wheels approved for your vehicle.
Make sure that the wheel’s specifications match those of the original wheels.

Always use the size and type of tires 
recommended in this owner’s manual.

Winter Tires
If driving on snowy or frozen roads, mount all season marked M+S tires, snow tires, 
or tire chains; reduce speed; and maintain sufficient distance between vehicles when 
driving.

1Winter Tires

Be particularly careful when operating the steering wheel or brakes to prevent 
skidding.

Use tire chains, snow tires, or all season tires when necessary or according to the 
law.

When mounting, refer to the following points.

For winter tires:
• Select the size and load ranges that are the same as the original tires.
• Mount the tires to all four wheels.
For tire chains:
• Install them on the front tires only.
• Because your vehicle has limited tire clearance, we strongly recommend using the 

chains listed below:
Models with 235/60R18 tires
Peerless Auto-Trac 231905

Models with 235/55R19 tires
Peerless Auto-Trac 232405

• Follow the chain manufacturer’s instruction when installing. Mount them as 

tightly as you can.

• Check that the chains do not touch the brake lines or suspension.
• Drive slowly.

uuChecking and Maintaining Tires uWinter Tires

3WARNING

Using the wrong chains, or not properly 
installing chains, can damage the brake 
lines and cause a crash in which you can be 
seriously injured or killed.

Follow all instructions in this owner’s 
manual regarding the selection and use of 
tire chains.

NOTICE
Traction devices that are the wrong size or improperly 
installed can damage your vehicle’s brake lines, 
suspension, body, and wheels. Stop driving if they are 
hitting any part of the vehicle.

When tire chains are mounted, follow the chain 
manufacturer’s instructions regarding vehicle 
operational limits.

If your vehicle is equipped with summer tires, be

Climate Control System Maintenance

Air Conditioning
To ensure proper and safe operation, the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE 
J2845) recommends that the refrigerant system only be serviced by trained and 
certified technicians.

Never repair or replace the air conditioning evaporator (cooling coil) with one 
removed from a used or salvaged vehicle.

New replacement mobile air conditioning evaporators must be certified (and 
labeled) as meeting SAE Standard J2842.

1Air Conditioning

NOTICE
Vented refrigerant is harmful to the environment.
To avoid refrigerant from venting, never replace the 
evaporator with one removed from a used or 
salvaged vehicle.

Refrigerant in your vehicle’s air conditioning system is 
flammable and can be ignited during servicing if 
proper procedures are not followed.

The air conditioner label is found under the hood:

Dust and Pollen Filter
The climate control system is equipped with a dust and pollen filter that collects 
pollen, dust, and other debris in the air. The Maintenance MinderTM messages will let 
you know when to replace the filter.

We recommend that you replace the dust and pollen filter sooner when using your 
vehicle in areas with high concentrations of dust.

1Dust and Pollen Filter

If the airflow from the climate control system 
deteriorates noticeably, and the windows fog up 
easily, the filter may need to be replaced. Please 
contact a dealer for replacement.

■ Applying Wax
A good coat of automotive body wax helps protect your vehicle’s paint from the 
elements. Wax will wear off over time and expose your vehicle’s paint to the 
elements, so reapply as necessary.

1Applying Wax

NOTICE
Chemical solvents and strong cleaners can damage 
the paint, metal, and plastic on your vehicle. Wipe 
away spills immediately.

■ Maintaining the Bumpers and Other Resin Coated Parts
If you get gasoline, oil, engine coolant, or battery fluid on resin coated parts, they 
may be stained or the coating may peel. Promptly wipe it away using a soft cloth and 
clean water.

1Maintaining the Bumpers and Other Resin Coated Parts

Ask a dealer about the correct coating material when 
you want to repair the painted surface of the parts 
made of resin.

■ Cleaning the Window
Wipe using a glass cleaner.

■ Maintaining Aluminum Wheels
Aluminum is susceptible to deterioration caused by salt and other road 
contaminants. When necessary, as early as possible use a sponge and mild detergent 
to wipe away these contaminants. Do not use a stiff brush or harsh chemicals 
(including some commercial wheel cleaners). These can damage the protective finish 
on aluminum alloy wheels, resulting in corrosion. Depending on the type of finish, 
the wheels also may lose their luster or appear burnished. To avoid water stains, 
wipe the wheels dry with a cloth while they are still wet.

■ Fogged Exterior Light Lenses
The inside lenses of exterior lights (headlights, brake lights, etc.) may fog temporarily 
if you have driven in the rain, or after the vehicle has been run through a car wash. 
Dew condensation also may build up inside the lenses when there is a significant 
enough difference between the ambient and inside lens temperatures (similar to 
vehicle windows fogging up in rainy conditions). These conditions are natural 
processes, not structural design problems in the exterior lights.
Lens design characteristics may result in moisture developing on the light lens frame 
surfaces. This also is not a malfunction.
However, if you see large amounts of water accumulation, or large water drops 
building up inside the lenses, have your vehicle inspected by a dealer.

If a Tire Goes Flat

Changing a Flat Tire
If a tire goes flat while driving, grasp the steering wheel firmly, and brake gradually 
to reduce speed. Then, stop in a safe place. Replace the flat tire with a compact 
spare tire. Go to a dealer as soon as possible to have the full-size tire repaired or 
replaced.

1. Park the vehicle on a firm, level, non-slippery surface and apply the parking brake.
2. Press the (P button.
3. Turn on the hazard warning lights and set the power mode to VEHICLE OFF.

1Changing a Flat Tire

Follow compact spare precautions:
Periodically check the tire pressure of the compact 
spare. It should be set to the specified pressure. 
Specified Pressure: 60 psi (420 kPa, 4.2 kgf/cm2)

When driving with the compact spare tire, keep the 
vehicle speed under 50 mph (80 km/h). Replace with 
a full-size tire as soon as possible.

The compact spare tire and wheel in your vehicle are 
specifically for this model. Do not use them with 
another vehicle. Do not use another type of compact 
spare tire or wheel with your vehicle.

Do not mount tire chains on a compact spare tire. 
If a chain-mounted front tire goes flat, remove one of 
the full-size rear tires and replace it with the compact 
spare tire. Remove the flat front tire and replace it 
with the full-size tire that was removed from the rear. 
Mount the tire chains on the front tire.

Do not use a puncture-repairing agent on a flat tire, 
as it can damage the tire pressure sensor.

Do not use the jack if it doesn’t work properly. Call 
your dealer or a professional towing service.

■ TPMS with Tire Fill Assist and the Compact Spare Tire
If you replace a flat tire with the spare tire, the low tire pressure/TPMS indicator 
comes on while you are driving. After driving for a few miles (kilometers), the 
indicator will start blinking for a short time and then stay on. Tire Pressure 
Monitor Problem appears on the driver information interface, but this is normal.

If you replace the tire with a specified regular tire, the warning message on the 
driver information interface and the low tire pressure/TPMS indicator will go off after 
a few miles (kilometers).

Emergency Engine Stop
The ENGINE START/STOP button may be used to stop the engine due to an 
emergency situation even while driving. If you must stop the engine, do either of the 
following operations:
• Press and hold the ENGINE START/STOP button for about two seconds.
• Firmly press the ENGINE START/STOP button three times.

The steering wheel will not lock. However, because turning off the engine disables 
the power assist the engine provides to the steering and braking systems, it will 
require significantly more physical effort and time to steer and slow the vehicle. Use 
both feet on the brake pedal to slow down the vehicle and stop immediately in a 
safe place.

The gear position automatically changes to (P after the vehicle comes to a complete 
stop.
U.S. models
Then, the power mode changes to VEHICLE OFF.
Canadian models
Then press the ENGINE START/STOP button twice without depressing the brake 
pedal to change the mode to VEHICLE OFF.

1Testing of Readiness Codes

The readiness codes are erased when the battery is 
disconnected, and set again only after several days of 
driving under a variety of conditions.

If a testing facility determines that the readiness 
codes are not set, you may be requested to return at 
a later date to complete the test.

If the testing facility determines the readiness codes 
are still not set, see a dealer.

Emissions Testing

Testing of Readiness Codes
Your vehicle has readiness codes as part of the onboard self diagnostic system. 
Some states use these codes for testing to verify whether your vehicle’s emissions 
components are working properly.
The codes may not be read properly if testing is performed just after the battery has 
gone dead or been disconnected.

To check if they are set, set the power mode to ON, without starting the engine. The 
malfunction indicator lamp will come on for several seconds. If it then goes off, the 
readiness codes are set. If it blinks five times, the readiness codes are not set.

If you are required to have your vehicle tested before the readiness codes are ready, 
prepare the vehicle for retesting by doing the following:

1. Fill the gas tank to approximately 3/4 full.
2. Park the vehicle and leave the engine off for 6 hours or more.
3. Make sure the ambient temperature is between 40°F and 95°F (4°C and 35°C).
4. Start the engine without touching the accelerator pedal, and let it idle for 20 

5. Keep the vehicle in (P. Increase the engine speed to 2,000 rpm, and hold it there 

seconds.

for about 3 minutes.

6. Let the engine idle with your foot off the accelerator for 20 seconds.
