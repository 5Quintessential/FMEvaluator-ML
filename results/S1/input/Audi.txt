 ZA WARNING

Do not assume the roads are free of ice based
on the outside temperature display. Be aware
that there may be ice on roads even when the
outside temperature is around 41 °F (+5 °C)
and thatice can increase the risk of accidents.

 
  

@ Tips

— Depending on vehicle equipment, the in-

strument illumination (needles and gauges)
may turn on when the lights are off and the
ignition is switched on. The illumination for
the gauges reduces automatically and even-
tually turns off as brightness outside in-
creases. This function reminds the driver to
turn the low beams on at the appropriate
time.

— You can select the units used for tempera-

ture, speed, and other measurementsin the
Infotainment system > page 247.

— If your vehicle is stationaryor if you are driv-
ing at very low speeds, the temperature dis-
played maybe slightly higher than the ac-
tual temperature outside due to the heat ra-
diating from the engine.

— At temperatures below 41 °F (+5 °C), a

snowflake symbol appearsin front of the
temperature display > A\.

Normal range

The engine has reached its operating tempera-
ture once the LEDs up to the center of the gauge
turn on. If the g indicator light in the instru-
ment cluster display turns on, the coolant tem-
perature is too high > page 21.

@) Note

— Auxiliary headlights and other accessories in
front of the air intake impair the cooling ef-
fect of the coolant. This increases the risk of
the engine overheating during high outside
temperatures and heavy engine load.

—The front spoiler also helps to distribute
cooling air correctly while driving. If the
spoiler is damaged, the cooling effect will
be impaired and the risk of the engine over-
heating will increase. See an authorized Au-
di dealer or authorized Audi Service Facility
for assistance.

Tachometer

The tachometerdisplays the engine speedin rev-
olutions per minute (RPM).

The beginning of the red zone in the tachometer
indicates the maximum permissible engine speed
for all gears once the engine has been broken in.
Before reaching this zone, you should shift into
the next highest gear, select the "D/S" selector
lever position, or remove your foot from the ac-
celerator pedal.

Coolant temperature
indicator

@) Note

The coolant temperature display @ > page 14,
fig. 3 or > page 14,fig. 4 only functions when
the ignition is switched on. To reducethe risk of
engine damage, please observe the following
notes about the temperature ranges.

Cold range

If only the LEDs at the bottom of the gauge turn
on, the engine has not reached operating tem-
perature yet. Avoid high engine speeds,full accel-
eration, and heavy engine loads.

The needle in the tachometer @) > page 14,
fig. 3 or > page 14, fig. 4 may only be in the
red area of the gauge for a short time or there
is a risk of engine damage. The location where
the red zone begins varies depending on the
engine.

@) For the sake of the environment

Upshifting early helps you to save fuel and re-
duces operating noise.

@) Tips

If the A indicator light turns on, the engine will
be automatically limited to the RPM displayed in
the instrumentcluster. This protects the engine
from overheating.

The engine speed limitation deactivates once the
engine is no longer in the critical temperature
range and you have released the accelerator ped-
al once.

If the engine speed limitation was activated by
an engine control malfunction, the By indicator
light also turns on. Make sure the engine speed
does not go abovethe speed displayed, for exam-
ple when downshifting. Drive to an authorized
Audi dealer or authorized Audi Service Facility im-
mediately to have the malfunction corrected.

G) Tips

Depending on the engine: the engine speed
may be limited when the engine is cold - the
full engine output will not be available. When
the engine is at operating temperature, the
red area in the tachometer moves to a higher
RPM range.

To help you see the curb when backing into a
parking space, the surface of the mirror tilts
slightly. For this to happen, the knob mustbe in
the position for the front passenger's exterior
mirror.

You can adjust the tilted mirror surface by turn-
ing the knob in the desired direction. When you

move out of reverse and into another gear, the
new mirror position is stored and assigned to the
key you are using.

The mirror goes back intoits original position
once you drive forward faster than 9 mph

(15 km/h) or turn the ignition off.

 ZA WARNING
Curved mirror surfaces (for example convex)

enlarge the field of vision. However, they
makeobjects in the mirror appear smaller and
farther away. You may estimate incorrectly
when you use these mirrors to gauge your dis-
tance from the vehicles behind you when
changing lanes, which increases the risk of an
accident.

 
  

(@) Note

— Applies to vehicles with power folding exte-

rior mirrors: if the mirror housing was
moved by outside forces (such as an impact
when maneuvering), you must use the pow-
er folding function to fold the mirror all the
way out. The mirrors will make a loud noise
when theylatch into place. The mirror hous-
ing must not be moved back into place by

hand because this could impair the function
of the mirror mechanism.

— Applies to vehicles without power folding
exterior mirrors: If the mirror housing was
moved by outside forces (such as an impact
when maneuvering), you must moveit back
in place by hand.

— If you wash the vehicle in an automatic car

wash, you mustfold the exterior mirrors in
to reducethe risk of damage to the mirrors.
Never fold power folding exterior mirrors*
by hand. Only fold them in and out using
the power controls.

G) Tips

— If the power adjusting function malfunc-
tions, the glass in both mirrors can be ad-
justed by pressing on the edge ofit by hand.
— The exterior mirror settings are stored with

the memoryfunction* > page 58.

Dimming the mirrors

Your vehicle is equipped with a manual or auto-
matic* dimming rearview mirror.

Manual dimming rearview mirror

> Pull the lever on the bottom of the mirror back.

Automatic dimming rearview mirror*

> The interior and exterior mirrors dim automati-

cally when light shines on them, for example
from headlights on a vehicle behind you.

 ZA\ WARNING
If the glass on an automatic dimming mirror
breaks, electrolyte can leak out. This liquid
can irritate the skin, eyes and respiratory sys-
tem. If there is contact with the fluid, flush
immediately with plenty of water. Consult a
physician if necessary.

— Repeated or long-term exposureto electro-

 
  

lyte fluid can lead toirritation of the air-
ways, especially in people with asthma or
other respiratory conditions. Take deep
breaths immediately after leaving the vehi-
cle or, if this is not possible, open all of the
doors and windowsas wide as possible.

— If electrolyte fluid enters the eyes, flush
them thoroughly with a large amount of
clean water for at least 15 minutes and then
seek medical attention.

— If electrolyte fluid comes into contact with
the skin, flush the affected area with clean
water for at least 15 minutes and then clean
with soap and water and seek medical atten-
tion. Clean affected clothing and shoes thor-
oughly before wearing again.

 
  

— If the fluid was swallowed and the person is
conscious, flush the mouth with water for at
least 15 minutes. Do not induce vomiting
unlessthis is recommended by medical pro-
fessionals. Seek medical attention immedi-
ately.

If the glass on an automatic dimming mirror
breaks, electrolyte can leak out. This liquid
damages plastic surfaces and paint. Clean
this liquid as quickly as possible, for example
with a wet sponge.

— If the light reaching the rearview mirror is
obstructed, the automatic dimming mirror
will not function correctly,

— The automatic dimming mirrors do not dim

when the interior lighting is turned on or
the reverse gear is selected.

— The rain sensor is only intended to assist the
driver. The driver may still be responsible for
manually switching the wipers on based on
visibility conditions.

— The windshield must not be treated with

water-repelling windshield coating agents.
Unfavorable conditions, such as wetness,
darkness or low sun, can result in increased
glare, which increases the risk of an acci-
dent. Wiper blade chatter is also possible.

@) Note

— If there is frost, make sure the windshield

wiper blades are notfrozen to the wind-
shield. Switching on the windshield wipers
when the blades are frozen to the wind-
shield can damage the wiper blades.

— The windshield wiper system must be

switchedoff (lever in position 0) before us-
ing a car wash. This prevents the wipers

washer system are heated when the ignition
is on if the outside temperatureis low.

— When stopping temporarily, such as at a
traffic light, the speed of the windshield
wipers automatically reduces by one level.

a roof rack system, because it changes the
driving characteristics by shifting the center
of gravity and/or the increasing the surface
area exposed to wind. You may need to
adapt your driving style and speed to the
current conditions.

 

 

() Note

Makesure that the luggage compartmentlid
and the panoramic glass roof* do not come in-
to contact with objects on the roof when they
are open.

@) For the sake of the environment

Fuel consumption will increase because of the
increased wind resistance. Removethe roof
rack when you are no longer using it.

G) Tips

Applies to: Vehicles with roof racks supplied
by the factory When installing roof rack sys-
tems on the roofrail, the ESC uses sensors to
adaptitself to a different center of gravity.

 

Fig. 75 Roof: mounting pointsfor the roof rack

> To open the flap above the attachment points,

press the flap downwardin the front area.

If luggage or cargo is to be carried on the roof,
you must observethe following:

— Only approved roof racks may be used on your

vehicle. These roofracks are the basis for a
complete roof rack system. Additional attach-

mentsor carrier systems are needed to trans-
port luggage and sports equipment. Roof racks
and attachments from the Audi Genuine Acces-
sories program are recommended.

— When installing the roof rack, make sure that it

is mounted only at the designated points on
the roof > fig. 75.

— Note the permitted axle load, permitted total

weight, and permitted roof load of your vehicle
=> page 376. The roof load is the total of the
weight of the roof rack, the attachments and
the cargo you are carrying. However, you must
also note the permitted load of the carrier sys-
tem being used.

 Z\ WARNING

— Follow the installation instructions provided

 

with the roof rack system. If you do not se-
cure the roof rack system and objects on the
roof correctly, they could come loose from
the vehicle and causean accident.

Climate control system

Applies to: vehicles with 3-zone deluxe automatic climate
control or 4-zone deluxe automatic climate control

The climate control system warms, cools and re-
moves humidity from the air in the vehicle interi-
or. It is most effective when the windowsand
sunroof* are closed. If there is a build-up of heat
inside the vehicle, ventilation can help to speed
up the cooling process.

In all heating mode functions except for defrost,
the blower only switches to a higher speed once
the engine coolant has reached a sufficient tem-
perature.

Pollutant filter

The pollutant filter removes pollutants such as
dust and pollen from the air.

Key recognition

The climate control settings are automatically
stored and assigned to the vehicle key that is in

use.

@) For the sake of the environment

— If you would like to reduce fuel consump-
tion, switch the air conditioning off. This
will also reduce emissions.

— In vehicles with a diesel engine, you can

switch the auxiliary heater off in the Info-
tainment system.

@) Tips

—To preventinterference with the heating

and cooling output and to prevent the win-
dowsfrom fogging over, the air intake in
front of the windshield mustbefree ofice,

snow,or leaves.

— Condensation from the cooling system can
drip and form a puddle of water under the
vehicle. This is normal and does not mean
there is a leak.

— The energy management system may tem-

porarily switch off certain functions, such as
the seat heating* or rear window defogger.
These systems are available again as soon as
the energy supply has been restored.

Driving

Driving

General information

A new vehicle must be broken in within the first
1,000 miles (1,500 km) so that all moving parts
work smoothly together, which helps to increase
the service life of the engine.

Do not drive higher than two-thirds of the maxi-
mum permitted engine RPM during the first 600
miles (1,000 km) and do notuse full accelera-
tion. The engine can be increased RPM gradually
during the next 300 miles (500 km).

Reducing the risk of vehicle damage

@ Note

When driving on poor roads, over curbs, and
on steep ramps, make sure that components
that hang below the vehicle, such as the spoil-
er and exhaust system, are not struck because

they could be damaged. This especially ap-
plies to vehicles with low ground clearance
and vehicles that are heavily loaded.

tem, can be severely damaged bydriving
through water.

— Always switch the Start/Stop system* off

when driving through water > page 79.

@) Tips

— Determine the depth before driving through

water.

— Do not stop the vehicle, drive in reverse, or
switch the engine off when driving through
water.

— Keep in mind that oncoming vehicles may
create wavesthat raise the water level and

makeit too deep for your vehicle to drive
through safely.

— Avoid driving through salt water, because

this can cause corrosion.

aieeReerie tele)
driving

The amount of fuel consumption, the environ-
mental impact, and the wear to the engine,
brakes, and tires depends mostly on your driving
style. Note the following information for efficient
and environmentally-conscious driving:

— Do not let the engine run while the vehicle

Driving through water on roads

parked.

Note the following to reduce the risk of vehicle
damage when driving through water, for example

on flooded roads:

— The water must not be any higher than the bot-

tom of the vehicle body.

— Do not drive faster than walking speed.

 Z\ WARNING
After driving through water or mud, the effec-
tiveness of the brakes may be reduced due to
moisture on the brake rotors and brake pads.
A few careful brake applications should dry off
the brakes and restorethe full braking effect.

 
  

— Use the Start/Stop system > page 79.

— Turn off electrical equipment that is not need-

ed, for example seat heating*.

— Anticipate upcoming traffic situations while

driving to avoid unnecessary acceleration and
braking.

— Utilize the engine braking effect.
— Avoid driving short distances or at high speeds

when possible.

— Avoid adding extra weight to the vehicle if pos-

sible, for example by notleaving roof racks or
bike racks installed when they are not needed.
— Have maintenance performed regularly on the

— Only adjust the steering column when the

vehicle is stationary so that you do notlose
control of the vehicle.

— Adjust the driver's seat or steering wheel so

that there is at least a 10 in (25 cm) dis-
tance between your chest and the steering
wheel. If you do not maintain this distance,
the airbag system will not be able to provide
its full protection.

 
  

— If your physical characteristics prevent you
from sitting at least 10 in (25 cm) or more

 

away from the steering wheel,see if an au-
thorized Audi dealer or authorized Audi
Service Facility can provide adapters that
will help.

— If your faceis level with the steering wheel,
the airbag does not provide as much protec-
tion during a collision. Always make sure
that the steering wheel is level with your
chest.

— Never hold the steering wheel in the 12

— Alwayshold the steering wheel with your

Driving

 

 

ZA\ WARNING
— Ifa gear is engaged while the vehicle is sta-

tionary and the engine is running, do not
press the accelerator pedal inadvertently.
Pressing the accelerator pedal will cause the
vehicle to move, and this could result in an
accident.
Emergency braking should only be used in
an emergency, when the when the standard
brake pedal is malfunctioning or obstructed.
During emergency braking, your vehicle will
brake similar to heavy braking. ESC and the
associated components(ABS, ASR, EDL) can-
not overcome the laws of physics. A full
brake application while driving through
curves or in poor road or weather conditions
can cause the vehicle to slide or the rear of
the vehicle to swerve, which increases the
risk of an accident.
If the power supplyfails, you cannot set the
parking brake onceit is released. In this
case, park the vehicle on level ground and
secure it by placing the selector lever in the
"P" position. See an authorized Audi dealer
or authorized Audi Service Facility for assis-
tance.
Alwaysset the parking brake when leaving
your vehicle, even if for a short period of
time. If the parking brakeis not set, the ve-
hicle could roll away, increasing the risk of
an accident.
If you leave the vehicle, switch the ignition
off and take the vehicle key with you. This
applies particularly when children remain in
the vehicle. Otherwise, children could start
the engine, release the parking brake, or op-
erate electrical equipment such as power

 
  

windows,which increasesthe risk of an acci-
dent.
No one, especially children, should remain in
the vehicle when it is locked. Locked doors
makeit more difficult for emergency work-

ers to enter the vehicle, which puts lives at
risk.

82

@) Note

Do not leave your vehicle unattended while
the engine is running, because this increases
the risk of an accident.

G) Tips

When stopping at a traffic signal or stopping
in city traffic, you can set the parking brake
manually. The vehicle does not have to be
held with the brake pedal. The parking brake
eliminates the tendency to creep whena se-
lector lever position is engaged. As soon as
you press the accelerator pedal, the parking
brake releases automatically and the vehicle
starts to move > page 82.

G) Tips

— Occasional noises when the parking brakeis

set and released are normal and are not a
cause for concern.

— The parking brake goes through a self-test

cycle at regular intervals when the vehicle is
stopped. Any noises associated with this are
normal.

— If there is a power failure, the parking brake

will not setif it is released, and it will not
release if it is set > A\. See an authorized

Audi dealer or authorized Audi Service Fa-
cility for assistance.

Starting to drive

Various convenience and safety functions may be

available when the vehicle begins driving, de-
pending on vehicle equipment.

Onlydrivein terrain that is suitable for the vehi-
cle and your driving ability. Never take any un-
necessary risks!

Before driving offroad

— Check the engine oil level, the tire pressure, the

coolant level and the fluid level in the washer
fluid reservoir.

— Store pieces of luggage and other objects in the

luggage compartment and secure them from
sliding out of place.

After driving offroad

— After driving offroad, remove branches and oth-

er debris from the radiator grille, underbody,
and wheels. Look especially for foreign objects
(such as stones) that may be stuck in the tire
tread.

— Clean the vehicle body and underbody and in-

spect the vehicle for possible damage.

— Clean the windows, headlights, tail lights and

the license plateif they are dirty.

— Perform a braketest (especially after driving

through water).

 ZA WARNING
— Be especially cautious and aware when driv-
ing under difficult conditions and when off-
road. Vehicle damage and injuries may occur
when driving at excessively high speeds or
with incorrect driving maneuvers.

— Always adjust your speed and driving style

to the roads,terrain, traffic and weather
conditions. Drive especially slowly if thereis
low visibility when offroad.

— Please note that the wheels can spin more
and the vehicle can swerve when in offroad
mode, especially when the road is slippery
or has loose surface material.

  
 

— Driving stability is reduced when in offroad

mode.

(@) For the sake of the environment

Avoid harming the environment and show
consideration for nature.

Difficult terrain and off-road

When driving in unfamiliar areas and offroad,
drive slowly and keep on the watch for unexpect-
ed obstacles (such as potholes,rocks, tree
stumps,etc.).

To prevent the vehicle from bottoming out and to
reduce the risk of underbody damage, you should
drive across uneven ground on only one side of
the vehicle so that only two of your wheels cross
the uneven area, instead of driving across the
center of the uneven area with all four wheels.

Drive quickly through sandy or marshyoff-road
sections and do notstop,if at all possible.

Driving through water

Also read the information found in > page 75.

Driving on aslope

If you are ever unableto drive up a hill, do not try
to turn around. Drive back down in reversein-
stead. Otherwise you run the risk of tipping over.

If the vehicle threatens to tip over when driving
across a slope, you must immediately steer
downhill in the direction of the slope.

Do not park your vehicle on steep hills.

To reduce the risk of tipping over, drive on hills in
the direction of the downwardslope (fall line) -
never crosswise.

The following data is based on ideal conditions.
The values may differ depending on the vehicle
load, road characteristics, and the area. The driv-
er is therefore responsible for deciding whether a
vehicle can handle a specific situation > A\.

Incline angle

Arising difference in altitude (incline) on a 109
yard (100 m) stretch is given in percentage or de-
grees. Specification of how steep of a grade the
vehicle can drive up using its own power (de-
pends on the road surface and the engine power,
among other things). Maximum permitted incline
angle: 31°

Ground clearance

The distance between the road surface and the
lowest point of the vehicle underbody.

— Vehicles with steel suspension: ground clear-

ance: 8.3 in (210 mm)

— Vehicles with air suspension*: maximum

ground clearance: 9.7 in (245 mm)

 Z\ WARNING

Exceeding the maximum specified values can
lead to serious injuries or vehicle damage.
— All specifications were determined based on
a level, firm, and non-slippery road surface
in dry weather conditions.

 
  

— The ideal conditions do not apply in offroad
driving. Do not alwaysgo all the way up to
the maximum values. Stay slightly below
them for safety.

The transmission automatically shifts up or down
beforecritical engine speed is reached.

The transmission only allows manual shifting
when the engine speed is within the permitted
range.

@ Tips

— If you shift to the next lowest gear, the

transmission will only shift if the engine will
not be over-rewved.

— With kick-down, the transmission shifts to a
lower gear, depending on vehicle speed and
engine speed.

— tiptronic does not work if the transmission

is running in emergency mode.

Kick-down enables maximum acceleration.

When you pressthe accelerator pedal down be-
yond the resistance point, the automatic trans-
mission downshifts into a lower gear and the en-
gine utilizes its full power,if the vehicle speed
and engine RPM permit. It shifts up into the next
higher gear once the maximum permitted engine
RPM is reached.

 ZA\ WARNING

Please note that the wheels could spin on
slick or slippery roads when kick-down is ac-
tive.

Trailer towing

 

Trailer towing

Engine cooling system

Driving with a trailer

eT re eeleurl tela}

Your vehicle is primarily intended for transport-
ing people and luggage. However, if you drive

Driving with a trailer affects the vehicle's fuel
consumption, performance and wear. It also re-
quires higher concentration from the driver.

 ZA WARNING
 
  

Do not transport any peoplein a trailer due to
the risk offatal injury.

Technical requirements

Certain requirements must be met when towing
a trailer.

Trailer hitch

Only use a trailer hitch with a removableball
hitch mount and ball hitch. The trailer hitch must
be permitted for the vehicle, the trailer and the
permitted total weight of the trailer being
pulled. Aboveall, it must be securely and safely
attached to the vehicle trailer.

Never mount a trailer hitch on the bumper. The
trailer hitch must be mounted in a way that does
not impair the function of the bumper. Do not
make any changesto the exhaust system and the
brake system.

Check regularlyif the trailer hitch is securely
mounted. Alwaysfollow the instructions given by
the trailer hitch manufacturer.

Trailer brakes

If the trailer has its own brake system, then fol-

low the manufacturer specifications. However,
the brake system on the trailer must never be
connected to the vehicle brake system.

92

with atrailer, follow the technical requirements,
the operation and driving tips, and the legal reg-
ulations.

Driving with a trailer means a higher load on the
engine and the cooling system. The cooling sys-
tem must be designed for additional load and
contain enough coolant > ©.

 ZA WARNING
— Never mount a "weight-distributing" or

"load-balancing" trailer coupler as the trailer
hitch. The vehicle was not designed for
these types oftrailer hitches. The trailer
hitch can malfunction and the trailer can
break off from the vehicle.

— If the trailer is equipped with electronic

brakes, these brakes cannotbe activated by
a factory-installed control system, which in-
creases the risk of an accident.

 
  

—To reducethe risk ofinjury, always remove
the ball hitch mount if no trailer is mount-

ed

@) Note

Longer inclines cannot be driven without a
suitable cooling system, especially if the out-
side temperatures are high. Otherwise, this
increases the risk of engine damage.

Operating instructions

Several things must be noted when towing a
trailer.

Towing capacity

The permitted towing capacity must not be ex-
ceeded under any circumstances > page 376.

You can drive up larger inclines if you are not us-
ing the maximum towing capacity.

The towing capacities given only apply to eleva-

tions up to 3,200 ft (1,000 m) above sea level. As
the elevation increases, the engine power de-
creases due to the decreasing air pressure. This
reduces the hill climbing ability and towing ca-
pacity. For every additional 3,200 ft (1,000 m),
the maximum permitted towing weight must be
reduced by approximately 10%. The permitted
towing weight is the combined weight of the
(loaded) vehicle and the (loaded) trailer.

 

Trailer towing

Tongue weight

Outside mirrors

The maximum permitted tongue weight of the
trailer drawbar on the trailer hitch ball head must
not be exceeded.

Having the tongue weight too low affects the ve-
hicle's handling. For driving safety, always using
the maximum permitted tongue weight is recom-
mended, but not exceed it. Distributing the cargo
in the trailer correctly will help to achieve this
weight.

You can determine the tongue weight using a
bathroom scale or a public weigh station, for ex-
ample.

The permitted tongue weight of your vehicle can
be found in the vehicle documentation or in
=> page 376.

Load distribution

Poor cargo load and distribution can negatively
impact vehicle handling. Load the trailer based
on the following criteria as much as possible:

— Store objects in the vehicle luggage compart-

ment,if possible. The vehicle should always
carry the heaviest possible load and the trailer
should have the lightest possible load.

— Distribute the load in the trailer so that the

heavy objects are as close to the axle as possi-
ble.

— Secure objects so that they do notslide.
— Utilize the maximum permitted tongue weight

if possible.

Tires

Set the tire pressure on your vehicle for a “full
load”; see the tire pressure sticker > page 336. If
necessary, also adjust the tire pressure on the
trailer according to the manufacturer's specifica-
tions.

The tire pressure must be increased an additional
3 PSI (0.2 bar) for towing loads over 6,600 lbs
(3,000 kg).

The trailer and the vehicle should be equipped
with winter tires when driving in winter tempera-

tures.

If you cannotsee the traffic behind the trailer
with the standard exterior mirrors, then you
must attach additional exterior mirrors. Adjust
them so you have a sufficientvisibility behind
you.

Exterior lighting

Follow the legal regulations regarding the light-
ing equipmenton your trailer. Contact an author-
ized Audi dealer or authorized Audi Service Facili-
ty for more information.

Before you start driving, check all lighting equip-
ment on the trailer while it is hitched to the vehi-
cle.

The headlight range control automatically ad-
justs the light range of the headlights.

Safety chains

Makesure the safety chains are correctly applied
when pulling a trailer. The chains should hang
enough so that the trailer can drive around
curves. However, they must not touch the
ground.

Driving with a trailer

Driving with a trailer requires extra caution.

Speed

Adhereto the legal speed limits. Follow the legal
regulations specific to the country.

As the speed increases, the driving stability of
the trailer decreases. Therefore you should not
exceed the maximum legal speed limit when
there are unfavorable road, weather, and/or wind
conditions. This especially applies when driving
downhill.

Hill

When you start driving uphill or downhill, trailers
maytilt or sway sooner than when driving ona

 ZA\WARNING
— Alwayspay attention to the traffic around

your vehicle when the cruise control system
is in operation. As the driver, you are always
responsible for your vehicle speed and the
distance between your vehicle and other ve-
hicles.

— For safety reasons,cruise control should not
be used in the city, in stop-and-go traffic, on
winding roads, and when road conditions are

poor (such as ice, fog, gravel, heavyrain,
and conditions that could lead to hydroplan-
ing), becausethis increases the risk of an ac-

— Switch the cruise control off temporarily

when driving in turning lanes, highwayexits,
or in construction zones.

— Please note that unconsciously “resting”

your foot on the accelerator pedal prevents
the cruise control from braking. This is be-
cause pressing the accelerator pedal over-
rides the cruise control system.

— Ifa brake system malfunction such as over-
heating occurs when the cruise control sys-
tem is switched on, the braking function in
the system may be switched off. The rest of
the cruise control system functions remain
active as long as the Gg (USA models) /
ES) (Canada models)indicator light is on.

 

 

 

@) Note

Before driving downhill a long distance ona
steep hill, decrease your speed and select a
lower gear. This makesuse of the engine brak-
ing effect and reduces the load placed on the
brakes.

G) Tips
The brake lights turn on when the brakes are
applied automatically.

However, if you are exceeding the stored speed by
a considerable amount for a long time, the cruise
control system will temporarily switch off. The

tion from the navigation system in order to react
proactively when driving. Information from the
camera-based traffic sign recognition* is also ap-
plied to recognize traffic signs > page 97. When
coming up to areas with speed limits or changes
in the course of the road (such as curves,inter-
sections or traffic circles), the system brakes au-
tomatically and then accelerates back up to the
set speed.

Overriding control

The driver can override the predictive control at
any time by pressing the accelerator or brake
pedal. If the system changes the vehicle speed to
adaptto speed limits, you can change the speed
using the lever > page 105,fig. 101.

Always switch off the predictive control in
the following situations:

— When increased attention is needed from the

driver.

— In poor weather conditions such as snow or

heavy rain.

— When driving on roads in poor condition.

Indicator in the instrumentcluster display

When switching on the adaptive cruise control
for the first time, a message will appear in the

available.

The Been symbol appears when the system
is regulating the speed to match a speed limit. If
this is the case, the system is regulating a speed
of 50 mph (80 km/h). The speed is then taken

— After switching on the ignition, the system

initially adjusts to a speed of 80 mph

(130 km/h) when driving onto highways
without a speed limit. Then the system ad-
justs to the last speed stored by the driver.

— There is no adaptation to speed limits when

driving through highwayinterchanges and
when driving on or off the expressway.

— There is no predictive control at speed limits

under 20 mph (30 km/h).

Fig. 95 Detection range

The adaptive cruise control system is a combina-
tion of speed and distance regulation. It assists
the driver by both regulating the speed and
maintaining a distance to the vehicle driving
ahead, within the limits of the system. If the sys-
tem detects a vehicle driving ahead, the adaptive
cruise control can brake and accelerate your vehi-
cle. This makes driving more comfortable both on
long stretches of highway and in stop-and-go
traffic.

What can adaptive cruise control do?

The adaptive cruise control system usesvideo, ra-
dar, ultrasound and navigation data. Vehicles
driving ahead can be recognized up to 650 ft
(200 m) away.

Predictive functions offer the driver additional
comfort and contribute to the reduction in fuel
consumption and CO2 emissions > page 99.

>

 

101

Assist systems

 

On open roads with no traffic, it functions like a
cruise control system. The stored speed is main-
tained. When approaching a vehicle driving
ahead, the adaptive cruise control system auto-
matically brakes to match that vehicle's speed
and then maintains the set distance. As soon as
the system does not detect a vehicle driving
ahead, adaptive cruise control accelerates up to
the stored speed.

In stop-and-go traffic, adaptive cruise control can
brake until the vehicle is stationary and then can
also start driving again automatically under cer-
tain conditions > page 106.

In traffic jams or stop-and-go traffic, traffic jam
assist can assist the driver > page 107.

Which functions can be controlled?

When you switch adaptive cruise control on, you
can set the current speed as the “control speed”
=> page 103, Switching on and off.

When driving, you can stop cruise control
= page 106 or change the speed > page 105 at
any time.

You can also set the distance to the vehicle driv-
ing ahead and set the driving mode of the adap-
tive cruise control > page 105.

torcycles, vehicles with high ground clearance
or an overhanging load are detected late or not
detected at all.

— When driving through curves > page 103.
— When the vehicle is stationary > page 103.

 

Z\ WARNING

Always pay attention to the traffic around you
when adaptivecruise control is switched on.
As the driver, you arestill responsible for your
own speed and the distance to other vehicles.
The adaptivecruise control is used to assist
you. The driver must always take action to
avoid a collision. The driver is always responsi-
ble for braking at the correct time.
— For safety reasons, do not use adaptive

cruise control when the road surfaceis in
poor condition and/or in bad weather condi-
tions (such as ice, fog, gravel, heavy rain and
hydroplaning). Using the system under
these conditions increasesthe risk of an ac-
cident.

— Switch adaptive cruise control off temporari-
ly when driving in turning lanes, on express-
way exits (except if predictive control is
switched on) or in construction zones. This
prevents the vehicle from accelerating to
the stored speed when in these situations.
— The adaptive cruise control system will not

brakeby itself if you put your foot on the ac-
celerator pedal. Doing so can override the
speed and distance regulation.

— When approaching stationary obstacles

such as stopped traffic, adaptive cruise con-
trol will respond with limited function.

In a speed range under 40 mph (65 km/h), traffic
jam assist can help to keep the vehicle within a
lane calculated by the system. Within the limits
of the system, the system controls the steering
automatically when adaptive cruise control is
switched on. Since traffic jam assist is only an as-
sist system, the driver must always keep his or
her hands on the steering wheel and be ready to
steer. The driver can override the control at any
time byactively steering.

The system is designed for driving on express-
ways and highways.

Audi pre sense

Introduction

Applies to: vehicles with Audi pre sense

Within the limits of the system, the pre sense

functions can initiate measuresin particularly
dangerous situations to protect the vehicle pas-
sengers and other road users.

— Due to the interlinking of various vehicle sys-

tems, critical driving situations can be detected
by pre sense basic and measures for preventa-
tive occupantprotection are can be initiated.

— The pre sensefront system uses the data from
the adaptive cruise control* radar sensors and
the camera to calculate the probability of a col-
lision. Within the limits of the system, an im-
pending collision with vehicles can be detected
in both urban and rural speed ranges. In this
case, the system warns the driver visually,
acoustically and with a jerk on the brakes if nec-
essary. If needed, it can initiate a partial or full
deceleration to reduce the collision speed or to
avoid the collision under certain circumstances.
In conjunction with pre sense basic/rear, the
front safety belts are also reversibly tensioned
when needed. The pre sense front is also active
when adaptivecruise control” is switched off.

— Pre senserear contains pre sense basic func-

tions. It uses the data from the side assist* ra-
dar sensors and calculates within the limits of
the system the probability of a rear end colli-
sion with the vehicle behind you. Pre sense rear
is also active when side assist* is switched off.
— Within the limits of the system, pre sensecity

uses the camera data and can detect an im-
pending collision with vehicles and pedestrians.
In this case, the system warns the driver visual-
ly, acoustically and with a jerk on the brakes if

necessary. If needed, it can initiate a full decel-
eration to reduce the collision speed or to avoid
the collision under certain circumstances. In
conjunction with pre sense basic/rear, the front

@) Tips

— Certain pre sense functions switch off when

driving in reverse.

— The pre sense functions may notbe availa-
ble if there is a malfunction in the ESC sys-
tem or the airbag control module.

— Note that the reversible belt tensioner on

the front passenger's side deactivates when
the front passenger's airbag is deactivated.

— Switch the pre sense off when you are not

using public streets or when loading the ve-
hicle onto a vehicle carrier, train, ship, or
other type of transportation. This can pre-
vent an undesired intervention from the pre

sense system.

Audi pre sensebasic

Applies to: vehicles with Audi pre sense basic

The pre sense basic functions are activated at a
speed of approximately 20 mph (30 km/h) or
higher.

The following functions can be triggered under
certain conditions within the limits of the sys-

—Tensioning of the safety belts (for example,
during heavy braking): the front safety belts
have reversible belt tensioners. If a collision
does notoccur, the safety belts will loosen
slightly and be readyto trigger again.

Audi pre sense

Fig. 109 Instrument cluster: approach warning

Description

Within the limits of the system, pre sense front
can warn you of impending collisions and initiate
the corresponding braking maneuvers or the sup-
porting measures when avoiding a collision.

If detected in time, the system can rank the dan-
gerous situation as critical if a vehicle driving
ahead brakes suddenly, if your own vehicle is ap-
proaching a significantly slower vehicle at high
speed or when thereis an oncoming vehicle dur-
ing a turning maneuver.

If detection is not possible, then pre sense front
does not react.

Warnings

The system recognizes various dangerous situa-
tions. The early warning occursif:

If a collision is imminent, the system will first
provide an acute warning by braking sharply. You
will also warned by an indicator in the instrument
cluster display > fig. 109. If you do notreact to
the acute warning, pre sense front can brake with
increasing force within the limits of the sys-
tem )). This reduces the vehicle speed in the
event of a collision. At low vehicle speeds, pre
sense front can initiate a complete deceleration
shortly before a collision with a vehicle driving
ahead ). If pre sense front determines that you
are not braking strongly enough when a collision
is imminent, it can increase the braking force.

The following functions trigger in conjunction
with pre sense basic/rear at corresponding vehi-
cle speeds:

— Reversible tensioning of the front safety belts

— Closing the windowsand sunroof*
— Inflating the side bolsters* in the seat backrest

and seat surface

Audi drive select*: the reversible belt tensioner,
the closing of the windowsand sunroof* as well
as the inflating of the side bolsters* on the seat
backrest and seat surface are not active depend-
ing on the mode selected.

Evasive steering support

— Avehicle driving ahead brakes suddenly

Evasive steering support helps you to steer the
vehicle around an obstacle in acritical situation.
If you avoid an obstacle after the acute warning,
then the evasive steering support assists you by
applying slight steering adjustment to correct
your steering wheel angle as long as you are ac-
tively steering. Evasive steering supportis availa-
ble at speeds between approximately 20 mph

— your own vehicle approachesa significantly

slower vehicle or stationary vehicle in the direc-
tion of travel

When this warning occurs, it may only be possi-
ble to avoid a collision by swerving or braking
strongly. The message Audi pre sense A

Turn assist

When starting to drive and up to speeds of maxi-
mum 6 mph (10 km/h), the turn assist uses a
braking intervention to prevent your vehicle from
colliding with an oncoming vehicle when turning
left or right (available in certain countries). The
braking intervention causes your vehicle to stay
in its lane.

braking maneuver if needed. Pre sense city is ac-
tive at speeds of approximately 6 mph (10 km/h)
and higher.

A pedestrian warning can occur at speeds up to
50 mph (85 km/h), and vehicle warnings can oc-
cur at speeds up to 155 mph (250 km/h). A pre
sense city braking maneuver is possible at speeds
up to 50 mph (85 km/h).

Warnings

The system recognizes various dangerous situa-
tions. The early warning occursif:

—Avehicle driving ahead brakes suddenly
— Your own vehicle approaches a vehicle in front
of you that is traveling at a significantly slower
speed or that is stationary

ing into the lane

When this warning occurs, it may only be possi-
ble to avoid a collision by swerving or braking
strongly. The message Audi pre sense wa
=> page 112, fig. 109 and a warning tone will
warn you about the danger.

The brakes mayalso be applied as an acute warn-
ing when thereis an impending collision. If you
do not react to the acute warning, pre sensecity
can brake to the point of complete deceleration
within the limits of the system. This reduces the
vehicle speed in the eventof a collision. The mes-
sage Audi pre sense wa also appears.

The following functions are triggered in conjunc-
tion with pre sense basic/rear:

— Reversible tensioning of the front safety belts
— Closing the windows and sunroof*
— Inflating the side bolsters* in the seat backrest

and seat surface

Audi drive select*: the function is not active de-
pending on the mode selected.

— In trailer mode, the braking behavior of the
trailer can be different than usual during au-
tomatic braking.

Pre sense city maybe restricted or unavailable
in the following types ofsituations:
—In heavy fog, rain, spray, or snow
— When thereare visual obstructions, such as

maybe unexpected or may not occur.

— The cameraview can be restricted, for exam-

ple by vehicles driving ahead or byrain,

system will warn you with corrective steering.
You can override this steering at any time. If you
pass over a line, the steering wheel will vibrate
lightly. In order for this warning vibration to oc-
cur, it must first be switched on in the Infotain-
ment system. Active lane assist is ready for oper-
ation when the lane marker line is detected on at
least one side of the vehicle.

The system is designed for driving on express-
ways and highways and therefore only activates
at speeds above approximately 40 mph (65
km/h).

Applies to: vehicles with side assist: if you acti-
vate a turn signal when active lane assist is ready
and it classifies a lane change as critical because
of vehicles traveling alongside you or approach-
ing you, there will be noticeable corrective steer-
ing shortly before you leave the lane. This will at-
tempt to keep your vehicle in the lane.

Applies to: vehicles without side assist: the ready

system does not warn you if you activate a turn
signal before crossing the lane marker line. In
this case, it assumes that you are changing lanes
intentionally.

Applies to: vehicles with adaptive cruise control:
there is no corrective steering or warnings if the
system recognizes a distinct passing maneuver. If

the conditions are met,traffic jam assist switches
on at speeds under approximately 40 mph
(65 km/h) > page 107.

 Z\ WARNING
— The system warns the driver that the vehicle
is leaving the lane using corrective steering.
The driver is always responsible for keeping
the vehicle within the lane.

— Corrective steering may notoccur in certain

— The system can assist the driver in keeping
the vehicle in the lane, but it does not drive
by itself. Always keep your hands on the
steering wheel.

 
  

— There may be cases where the camera does
not recognize all lane marker lines. Correc-
tive steering can only take place on the side

situations, such as during heavy braking.

Fig. 114 Display on the exterior mirror

Side assist (lane change assist) helps you monitor
your blind spot and traffic behind your vehicle.
Within the limits of the system, it warns you
about vehicles that are coming closer or that are
traveling with you within sensor range @)
> fig. 113. If a lane change is classified as criti-
cal, the display @) in the exterior mirror turns on
> fig. 114.

The display in the left exterior mirror provides as-
sistance when making a lane change to the left,
while the display in the right exterior mirror pro-
vides assistance when making a lane change to
the right.

Information stage

As long as you do notactivate the turn signal,
side assist informs you about vehicles that are
detected and classified as critical. The display in

the mirror turns on, but is dim.

The display remains dim in the information stage
so that your view towardthe front is not distur-
bed.

Warning stage

If the display in a mirror blinks brightly when you
activate a turn signal, side assist is warning you
about detected vehicles that it has classified as
critical. If this happens, check traffic by glancing
in the exterior mirrors and over your shoulder
=> A in General information on page 121.

Applies to: vehicles with active lane assist: the
display in the mirror can also blink if you have not
activated a turn signal: if you are approaching a

the sooner the display in the outside mirror will
turn on.

Vehicles traveling with you

Vehicles traveling with you are indicated in the
exterior mirror if they are classified as critical for
a lane change. All vehicles detected by side assist
are indicated by the time they enter your “blind
spot”, at the latest.

© Vehicles you are passing

If you slowly pass a vehicle that side assist has
detected (the difference in speed between the ve-
hicle and your vehicle is less than approximately
9 mph (15 km/h)), the display in the exterior mir-
ror turns on as soon as the vehicle enters your
blind spot.

The display will not turn on if you quickly pass a
vehicle that side assist has detected (the differ-

ence in speed is greater than approximately 9
mph (15 km/h)).

Functional limitations

The radar sensors are designed to detect the left
and right adjacent lanes when the road lanes are
the normal width. In some situations, the display
in the exterior mirror may turn on even though
thereis no vehicle located in the area that is criti-
cal for a lane change. For example:

— If the lanes are narrow or if you are driving on

the edge of your lane. If this is the case, the
system may have detected a vehicle in another
lane that is not adjacent to your current lane.
— If you are driving through a curve. Side assist
mayreact to a vehicle thatis in the same lane
or one lane over from the adjacentlane.

—If side assist reacts to other objects (such as

roadside structures like guardrails).

— In poor weather conditions. The side assist

functions are limited.

Do not cover the radar sensors > fig. 116 with
stickers, deposits, bicycle wheels or other ob-
jects, becausethis will impair the function. For
information on cleaning, see > page 346.

A WARNING

— Alwayspay attention to traffic and to the

area around your vehicle. Side assist cannot
replace a driver's attention. The driver alone
is always responsible for lane changes and
similar driving maneuvers.

—Insome situations, the system may not

function or its function may be limited. For
example:
— If vehicles are approaching or being left

behind very quickly. The display may not

turn onin time.

— In poor weather conditions such as heavy

rain, snow or heavy mist.

— On very wide lanes, in tight curves, or if

there is a rise in the road surface. Vehicles
in the adjacent lane may not be detected
because they are outside of the sensor

range.

 

 

 

@) Note

The sensorscan bedisplaced by impacts or
damage to the bumper, wheel housing and
underbody. This can impair the system. Have
an authorized Audi dealer or authorized Audi
Service Facility check their function.

The night vision assist can detect, highlight and,
if necessary, warn about pedestrians and large
wild animals.

Night vision assist helps you when it is dark by
using an infrared camera to monitor the area in
front of your vehicle, within the limits of the sys-
tem. It can display objects up to a distance of

Fig. 125 Frontof the vehicle: night vision assist camera

Pay attention to traffic and the area around
your vehicle when night vision assist is switch-
ed on. The driver is always responsible for as-
sessing the traffic situation.

— Night vision assist can only warn about peo-
ple and wild animals located within the visu-
al range of the infrared camera. The visual
range corresponds to the image in the in-
strument cluster display.

— Night vision assist may not detect people or

wild animals and mark them if:

— They are notin an upright position, for ex-

ampleif theyare sitting or lying down
and/or

— The silhouette in the display appearsin-

completeor interrupted, for example be-
cause the person is partially covered by a
parked vehicle or an animal is covered by
tall grass. This could increase the risk of an
accident.

— Never try to swerve around animalsif doing
so will endanger you or other road users, be-
cause this increases the risk of an accident.

 ZA\ WARNING

 

The following situations may affect the function
of the night vision assist system:

(i) Tips

— Poor visibility such as snow,rain, fog or heavy

spray

— Dirty lens on the night vision assist camera

Makesure the night vision camera > fig. 125 is
not covered by stickers, deposits or any other ob-
structions because this can impair the night vi-
sion assist function. For information on cleaning,
see > page 346.

— Even though the system evaluates the

shape and heat given off byall detected ob-
jects, there are limits to the system. There
maybe false warnings.

— For technical reasons, the image pausesin

split second intervals.

Audi drive select

Introduction

Applies to: vehicles with Audi drive select

Drive select makes it possible to experiencedif-
ferent types of vehicle characteristics in one vehi-
cle. You can select the driving modes Offroad* or
Lift / Offroad*, Allroad*, Comfort, Auto and Dy-
namic in the Infotainment system, for example
to switch from a sporty to a comfortable driving
mode. In the Individual mode, the settings can
be adjusted to your personal preferences. This
makesit possible to combine settings such as a
sporty engine setting with light steering.

Applies to: vehicles with Audi drive select

The following systems, among other things, are
influenced by drive select:

Engine and automatic transmission

Depending on the mode, the engine and auto-
matic transmission respond more quickly or ina
more balanced manner to accelerator pedal
movements. In the sporty Dynamic mode, the
transmission shifts at higher speed ranges.

127

Assist systems

 

Air suspension
Applies to: vehicles with air suspension

The air suspension is an electronically-controlled
suspension and leveling system. The firmness of
the suspension will adapt to the driving condi-
tions and the driving situation. The system balan-
ces out changesin load. The vehicle level will also
adapt gradually to the vehicle speed in order to
reduce the wind resistance at high speeds and in-
crease the ground clearance at low speeds. The
settings depend on the selected Audi drive se-
lect* mode.

Steering

The power steering adapts. Indirect steering that
moves easily as in Comfort mode is especially
suited to long drives on highways. The Dynamic
mode provides sporty, direct steering.

All-wheel steering*

All-wheel steering increases driving comfort by
providing additional steering ability at the rear
axle. Steering in the opposite direction at low
speeds decreasesthe turning radius. Steering in
the same direction at high speeds improves the
response time while increasing driving stability at
the same time.

Sport differential*

As a componentofthe all wheel drive system
(quattro) > page 151, the sport differential dis-
tributes the driving power to the rear axle de-
pending on the situation. The distribution of
power varies depending on the selected mode
from moderate (Comfort) to sporty (Dynamic).
The goal is a high level of agility and ability to ac-
celerate on curves. The vehicle is very responsive
to steering.

Adaptive cruise control (ACC)*

The behavior when accelerating can be adjusted
from comfortable to sporty, depending on the
drive select mode. Adaptive cruise control also
responds to the driving behavior of the vehicle
ahead in a more conservative or sporty manner.

Engine sound*

The engine sound adaptsto the current mode
and can be subtle to sporty.

C@) Note

Applies to: vehicles with air suspension

— Make sure there is enough clearance above

and below the vehicle when parking. The
height of the vehicle (ground clearance) can
change onceit is parked due to temperature
fluctuations, changes to the load condi-
tions, and changes to the driving modes.

— When transporting the vehicle on acar car-

rier, train, ship, or by other means,only se-
cure the vehicle at the outer circumference
of the tires (the tread surface). Securing the
vehicle at the axle components, suspension
struts, or towing eyesis not permitted be-
cause the pressure in the air suspension
struts can change during transport. The ve-
hicle might not be secured sufficiently if this
happens.

@ Tips

The "S"selector lever position automatically
engages when the Dynamic mode is selected.

over obstacles to maintain maximum ground
clearance.

Allroad* - only for air suspension*: the vehicle
lifts to maintain higher ground clearancefor dif-
ficult stretches of road.

Comfort - provides a comfort-oriented vehicle
setup and is suited for long drives on highways.

Auto- provides an overall comfortable yet dy-
namic driving feel and is suited for everyday use.

Parallel parking is described here. The process is
the same for perpendicular parking.

Searching for parking spaces

> Drive forward to the row of parking spaces at a
low speed. For the best parking results, the ve-
hicle should be approximately 3 feet (1 m) from
the row ofparking spaces.

> The parking space search is first done on one

side of the lane. To switch the side for the park-
ing space search, activate the turn signal for
that side.

Park assist only displays parking spaces that are
suitable for the length and width of the vehicle.

@) Note

— Parking spaces classified as suitable by the
system may have been detected incorrectly.
The driver must decide if the parking space
displayed is suitable for the vehicle.

— Certain conditions near the parking space

may cause the parking process tofail, such
as if the parking space is near trees or posts,

or if the ground is covered, for example,

with gravel, snow,or ice.

@) Tips

— You can select a space from all of the park-

ing options found. The possible parking
space will be displayed until you are too far
awayfrom it.

— You will achieve the best results when park-

ing if you keep your vehicle as parallel as
possible to the other parked vehicles or the
edge of the road.

— If you did not drive past a suitable parking

space too quickly, the system can also be ac-
tivated afterwards by pressing the Pe button
and activating the turn signal.

— If suitable parking spacesare available on

Intelligent Technology

Electronic Stabilization
Control (ESC)

Electronic Stabilization Control (ESC) supports
driver safety. It reduces the risk of slipping and
improves driving stability. ESC detectscritical sit-

uations, such as if the vehicle is oversteering or
understeering, or if the wheels are spinning. The
brakes are applied or the engine torque is re-
duced in order to stabilize the vehicle. When the
ESC engages, the B indicator light blinks in the
instrumentcluster.

The following systems are integrated in the ESC:

Anti-lock braking system (ABS)

ABS prevents the wheels from locking when brak-
ing. The vehicle can still be steered even during
hard braking. Apply steady pressure to the brake
pedal. Do not pump the pedal. A pulsing in the
brake pedal indicates that the system is acting to
stabilize the vehicle.

Brake assist system

The brake assist system can decrease braking dis-
tance. It increases braking power when the driver
presses the brake pedal quickly in emergency sit-
uations. You must press and hold the brake pedal
until the dangerous situation is over. In vehicles

with adaptive cruise control*, the brake assist
system is more sensitive if the distance detected
to the vehicle driving ahead is too small.

On vehicles with activated and functioning night

vision assist*, the brake assist system can re-
spond moresensitively if there is a warning.

Anti-Slip Regulation (ASR)

ASR reduces engine power when the drive wheels
begin spinning and adaptsthe force to the road
conditions. This makes it easier to start, acceler-

ate and drive up hills.

Electronic Differential Lock (EDL)

The EDL applies the brakes to wheels that are
slipping and transfers the drive power to the oth-

146

er wheels. This function is not available at higher
speeds.

In extreme cases, EDL automatically switches off
to keep the brake on the braked wheel from over-
heating. The vehicleis still functioning correctly.
EDL will switch on again automatically when con-
ditions have returned to normal.

Power steering

The ESC can also supportvehicle stability
through steering.

Selective wheel torque control

Selective wheel torque control is used when driv-
ing on curves. Braking is targeted toward the
wheelson the inside of the curve as needed. This
allows moreprecise driving in curves.

Automatic post-collision braking system

The “automatic post-collision braking system”
can help to reduce the risk of sliding and of addi-
tional collisions after an accident. If the airbag
control module detects a collision, the vehicleis
braked by the ESC.

The vehicle does not brake automatically if one of
the following occurs:

— The driver presses the accelerator pedal,

— The ESC, the brake system, or the vehicle elec-

trical system is not functioning

 ZA WARNING
— The ESC and its integrated systems cannot

overcome the limits imposed by natural
physical laws. This is especially important on
slippery or wet roads. If the systems begin
acting to stabilize your vehicle, you should
immediately alter your speed to match the
road and traffic conditions. Do notlet the in-
creased safety provided tempt you into tak-
ing risks. This could increase your risk of a
collision.

— Please notethe risk of a collision increases

when driving fast, especially through curves
and on slippery or wet roads, and when driv-
ing too close to objects ahead. The ESC and

condition. Different tire sizes can lead toa
reduction in engine power.

— You mayhear noises when the systems de-

scribed are working.

— When installing roof rack systems on the
roof rail, the ESC uses sensorsto adaptit-
self to a different center of gravity.

 

its integrated systems cannot alwayspre-
ventcollisions - thereis still a risk of acci-
dents!

— Press the accelerator pedal carefully when
accelerating on smooth, slippery surfaces
such as ice and snow.The drive wheels can
spin even when thesecontrol systems are in-
stalled and this can affect driving stability
and increase the risk of a collision.

 
  

@ Tips

— The ABS and ASR only function correctly

Hill descent assist brakes all four wheels auto-
matically in order to limit speed when driving ei-
ther forward or reverse on hills with a grade from
approximately 6 to 60%. The wheels will not lock
up because the ABS remains activated.

— The stabilization function is limited when
offroad mode is switched on. The driving
wheels could spin and the vehicle could
swerve, especially on slick or slippery road
surfaces.

You should only switch offroad mode on or
switch ESC/ASR off if your driving abilities and
the traffic conditions permit. Thereis a risk of
sliding.

When hill descent assist is on, the speed your ve-
hicle was traveling when it entered the hill is
maintained. The assist begins shortly after you
start driving and continues up to approximately
19 mph (30 km/h). The driver can increase or de-
crease the vehicle speed within these limits by
pressing the accelerator or brake pedal.

However, there must be enough traction. Hill de-
scent assist cannot function as expected, if for
example the hill is icy or if the surface is loose
SA.

Active regulation of a speed up to approximately
19 mph (30 km/h)is signaled in the instrument
cluster by an indicator light ZB The indicator
light turns on when in the ready mode.

The system does not work at speeds above ap-
proximately 19 mph (30 km/h). The system is
then in ready-mode. This is indicated by the LED
in the button turning on.

Hill descent assist is automatically activated un-
der the following conditions:

— the LED in the button turns on

 

 

Intelligent Technology

— the vehicle speed is lower than 19 mph (30

km/h)

—the hill angle is at least approximately 6%

 

Z\ WARNING

— Be ready to apply the brakesat all times

when using the hill hold assist.

— Always adjust the speed to the visibility,

weather, road, and traffic conditions. The
system cannotreplacethe driver's atten-
tion.

 
  

— The system cannot maintain a constant vehi-
cle speed in all situations, for example when
on smooth or slippery ground. This can in-
creasethe risk of an accident.

Brakes

New brake pads

New brake pads do not achievetheir full braking
effect during the first 250 mi (400 km). They

must be “broken in”first. However, you can com-

pensatefor the slightly reduced braking force by
pressing firmly on the brake pedal. Avoid heavy
braking during the break-in period.

Brake pad wear depends largely on the way the
vehicle is driven and on operating conditions.
Brake pad wear increases when driving frequently
in the city or short distances or when using a very
sportydriving style.

Operating noise

Noises may occur when braking depending on the
speed, braking force, and outside conditions such
as temperature and humidity.

Wetconditions or road salt

In certain situations, for example after driving
through water, in heavy rain, or after washing
your car, the braking effect may be reduced due
to moisture or ice on the brake rotors and brake
pads. The brakes must be “dried”first with a few
careful brake applications.

When driving at higher speeds while the wind-
shield wipers are switched on, the brake pads are
briefly pressed against the brake rotors. This ac-
tion, which is not felt by the driver, happens at

regular intervals and ensures a better reaction
time for the brakes in wet weather.

The braking effect can also be reduced if you are
driving on salted roads and you do not apply the
brakes for long periods of time. The layer of salt
on the brake rotors and pads must be worn off
first when the brakesare applied.

Corrosion

Leaving the vehicle parked for long periods of
time, low mileage on the vehicle, and avoiding
heavy braking can contribute to corrosion on the
brake rotors and to dirty brake pads.

If you usually avoid heavy braking or if thereis
corrosion present, occasional heavy braking at
high speeds is recommended to clean the brake
rotors and pads > A.

Brake system malfunction

If you notice that the brake pedal suddenly goes
downfarther toward the floor when you press it,
then a brakecircuit in the dual-circuit brake sys-
tem may have malfunctioned. Drive to an author-
ized Audi dealer or authorized Audi Service Facili-
ty immediately to have the problem corrected.
On the waythere, drive with reduced speed and
keep in mind that you will need a longer distance
to stop and you will need to press the brake pedal
harder.

Low brakefluid level

When the brakefluid level is low, malfunctions in
the brake system mayoccur. The brakefluid level
is electronically monitored.

Brake booster

The brake booster amplifies the pressure you ap-
ply to the brake pedal.

 Z\WARNING
— Only apply the brakes for the purpose of
cleaning the brake system when road and
traffic conditions permit. You must not en-
danger other road users and increase the
risk of an accident.

 
  

— Due to the risk ofinjury, only have an au-

thorized Audi dealer or authorized Audi

149

Intelligent Technology

 

 

Service Facility work on the brake system.
Incorrect repairs could impair the function.
— Never let the vehicle roll while the engine is
stopped because this increases the risk of an
accident.

 
  

C) Note

— Never let the brakes “rub” by pressing the
pedal lightly when braking is not actually
necessary. This causes the brakes to over-
heat and increases braking distance and
causes wear.

— Before driving downhill a long distance ona
steep hill, decrease your speed and select a
lower gear. This makes use of the engine
braking effect and reducesthe load placed
on the brakes. If you need to brake addition-
ally, brake in intervals and not continuously.

G) Tips

— If the brake booster is not working, you

mustpress the brake pedal with much more
force than normal.

— If you retrofit your vehicle with a front spoil-
er, wheel coversor similar items, make sure
that the air flow to the front wheels is not
obstructed. Otherwise the brake system can
overheat.

Intelligent Technology

All wheel drive (quattro)

ty. This significantly improves the starting ability
and increases the vehicle batterylife.

The all-wheel drive system distributes the driving
power variably to the front and rear axle to im-
prove the driving characteristics. It works togeth-
er with selective wheel torque control, which can
activate when driving through curves
=> page 146.

The all wheel drive concept is designed for high
engine power. Your vehicle is exceptionally pow-
erful and has excellent driving characteristics
both under normal driving conditions and on
snowand ice. Always read and follow safety pre-
cautions > A\.

 Z\ WARNING

— Even in vehicles with all wheel drive, you

should adapt your driving style to the cur-
rent road and traffic conditions to reduce
the risk of an accident.

— The braking ability of your vehicleis limited
to the traction of the wheels. In this way,it
is not different from a two wheel drive vehi-
cle. Do notdrive too fast because this in-

creasesthe risk of an accident.

— Note that on wetstreets, the front wheels
can “hydroplane’”if driving at speeds that
are too high. Unlike front wheel drive vehi-

 
  

cles, the engine RPM does notincrease sud-
denly when the vehicle begins hydroplaning.
Adapt your speed to the road conditions to
reduce the risk of an accident.

@)Tips

—If you drive short distances frequently, the

vehicle battery may not charge enough
while driving. As a result, convenience func-

tions for electrical equipment may be tem-
porarily unavailable.

— The vehicle battery will gradually drain if

the vehicle is not driven for long periods of
time, or if electrical equipment is used
when the engine is not running. To ensure
that the vehicle can still be started, the

electrical equipmentwill be limited or
switched off.

Notice about data
recorded by the Event
Data Recorder and
vehicle control modules

Event Data Recorder

This vehicle is equipped with an Event Data Re-
corder (EDR). The main purpose of an EDR is to
record, in certain crash or near crash-like situa-
tions, such as an airbag deployment or hitting a
road obstacle, data that will assist in understand-
ing how a vehicle's systems performed. The EDR
is designed to record data related to vehicle dy-
namics and safety systems for a short period of
time, typically 30 seconds or less. The EDR in this
vehicle is designed to record such data as:

— How various systems in your vehicle were oper-

Sykemetals

ating;

Applies to: Vehicles with sport differential

— Whether or not the driver and passenger safety

The sportdifferential distributes the drive power
to the rear axle based on the situation. The goal
is a high level ofagility and ability to accelerate
on curves. The vehicle is very responsive to steer-
ing. The settings depend on the selected Audi
drive select* mode.

Energy management

Your vehicle is equipped with an intelligent ener-
gy management system for distributing electrici-

belts were buckled/fastened;

— Howfar (if at all) the driver was depressing the

accelerator and/or brake pedal; and,

— Howfast the vehicle was traveling.

These data can help provide a better understand-
ing of the circumstancesin which crashes and in-
juries occur. NOTE: EDR data are recorded by your
vehicle only if a non-trivial crash situation occurs;
no data are recorded by the EDR under normal
driving conditions and no personal data (e.g.,

Intelligent Technology

 

a system fault is detected by a control module.
Some of the data stored mayrelate to vehicle

speed, direction, or braking, as well as restraint
system use and performance in the event of a
crash. Stored data can also only be read and
downloaded with special equipment thatis di-
rectly connected to the vehicle.

@) Tips

Your vehicle may be equipped with Audi con-
nect. Your use of certain Audi connect fea-
tures requires wireless services that are pro-
vided by a third party wireless telecommuni-
cations provider. For details regarding how in-
formation obtained through Audi connectis
collected, processed, transmitted, used, and
shared, please see your contract with the
wireless telecommunications provider.

name, gender, age, and crash location) are re-
corded. However, other parties, such as law en-
forcement, could combine the EDR data with the
type of personally identifying data routinely ac-
quired during a crash investigation.

To read data recorded by an EDR, special equip-
ment is required, and access to the vehicle or the
EDR is needed. In addition to the vehicle manu-
facturer, other parties, such as law enforcement,
that have the special equipment, can read the in-
formation if they have access to the vehicle or the
EDR.

Some state lawsrestrict the retrieval or down-
loading of data stored by EDRs installed in a vehi-
cle for the express purpose of retrieving data af-
ter an accident or crash event without the own-

er's consent.

Audi will not access the EDR and/or similar data
or give it to others-

— unless the vehicle owner (or lessee if the vehi-

cle has been leased) agrees; or

— upon the official request by the police; or
— upon the order of a court of law or a govern-

ment agency; or

— for the defense of a lawsuit through the judicial

discovery process.

— Audi mayalso use the data for research about

vehicle operation and safety performance or
provide the data to a third party for research
purposeswithout identifying the specific vehi-
cle or information about the identity of its own-
er or lessee and onlyafter the recorded vehicle
data has been accessed.

Vehicle control modules

Your vehicle is also equipped with a number of
electronic control modules for various vehicle
systems, such as engine management, emission
control, airbags, and safetybelts.

These electronic control modules record data
during normal vehicle operation that may be
needed by trained technicians for diagnostic and
repair purposes. The recording capability of these
modules is limited to data (no sound is recorded).
Only a small amount of data is actually recorded
over a very limited period of time, or stored when

Telephone

Introduction
Applies to: vehicles with telephone

To make phone calls in your vehicle using the
MMI, connect yourcell phone to the MMIvia
Bluetooth.

Handsfree

After you have connected your mobile device to
the MMI via Bluetooth, you can use the handsfree
system and operate telephone functions through
your MMI. You can makecalls using the antenna
on your mobile device.

With the Audi phone box’, calls are made using
the exterior antenna on the vehicle. Using the ex-
ternal antenna helps when thereis a low signal
and also provides better reception quality
=>page 181.

 ZA\ WARNING
— Medical experts warn that mobile devices

can interfere with the function of pacemak-
ers. Always maintain a minimum distance of
about 8 inches (20 cm) between the cell
phone antenna and the pacemaker.

— Do not carry the mobile device in a pocket

directly over the pacemaker when the
phone is switched on.

— Switch the mobile device off immediately

if you suspectit may be interfering with
the pacemaker.

— Do not use the voice recognition system*
= page 171 in emergencies because your
voice may change in stressful situations. The
system may take longer to dial the number
or may not be able to dial it at all. Dial the
emergency number manually.

— Switch your mobile device off in areas where

thereis a risk of an explosion. These loca-
tions are not always clearly marked. This
mayinclude gas stations, fuel and chemical
storage facilities or transport vehicles, or lo-
cations where fuel vapors (such as propane
or gasoline vapor in vehicles or buildings),
chemicals or large quantities of dust parti-
cles (such as flour, sawdust or metal) may

 

 

 

178

 

be present in the air. This also applies to all
other locations where you would normally
turn your vehicle engine off.

— The demands oftraffic require your full at-

 
  

tention. Always read the chapter
=> page 153, Traffic safety information.

@) Note

Alwaysfollow the information found in >@ in
Wi-Fi settings on page 200.

G) Tips

— The Bluetooth connection range is limited

to inside the vehicle. It can also be affected
by local conditions and interference with
other devices.

—To learn which Bluetooth connections and

which of the functions in your mobile device
are supported, check with your mobile de-
vice service provider or the database for mo-
bile devices at www.audiusa.com/

—The cell phone may become hotduring wire-
less charging. Pay attention to the tempera-
ture of your mobile device and be careful
when removing it from the Audi phone box.

— An alternating magnetic field is used for

wireless charging. Maintain a minimum dis-
tance of approximately 2.4 in (6 cm) to the
Audi phone box charging plate. The thresh-
olds for prolonged exposureatthis distance
comply with ICNIRP1998. Therefore, inter-
actions such as irritation of sensory organs,
malfunctions of active implants (such as
pacemakers, infusion pumps,or neurosti-
mulators) or effects on passive implants
(such as prosthetic limbs) is highly unlikely.
If you have an implant, consult a medical
specialist if you have any questions.

G@) Tips

— Snow and obstructions on the GPS antenna

or interference caused bytrees and large
buildings can impair satellite reception and
affect the system's ability to determine the
vehicle position. Several deactivated or mal-
functioning satellites can also interrupt GPS
reception and affect the system's ability to
determine the vehicle position.

— Because street names sometimeschange,

the names stored in the MMI mayin rare
cases differ from the actual street name.

Media

Introduction

There are various media drives and connections
available in the MMI. For example, you can play
audio/video* files from the Jukebox* or connect

your mobile device to the Audi music interface*
and operate it through the MMI.

Notes

Media and formatrestrictions: the MMI (includ-
ing the SD card reader and the USB storage de-
vice connection*) was tested with a variety of
products and media available in the market.
However, there may be cases whereindividual de-
vices or media and audio/video* files may not be
recognized, mayplay only withrestrictions or
maynotplayat all.

Digital Rights Management: please note that
the audio/video*files are subject to copyright
protection.

The media drives do notplayfiles that are pro-
tected by DRM and thatareidentified with the
symbol fi.

Data security: never store important data on SD

cards, the Jukebox*, CDs/DVDs or mobile devices.
Audi AG is not responsible for damaged or lost
files and media.

Loading times: the morefiles/folders/playlists
that are on a storage medium, the longer it will
take to load the audio/video* files. Audi recom-
mends using storage media that only contain au-
dio/videofiles*. To decrease the time it takes to

load audio/video files*, create subfolders (for ex-
ample, for the artist or album). The loading time
will also increase when importing files.

Additional information: when playing, audio
files are automatically displayed with any addi-
tional information that is stored (such as the ar-

tist, track and album cover). If this information is
not available on the storage medium, the MMI
will check the Gracenote metadata database.

CD/DVD operation

CD/DVDandformatrestrictions: the functionali-
ty ofindividual storage media maybe limited due
to the variety of blank CDs/DVDs available and
the various capacities. Audio CDs or video DVDs
with copy protection, CDs/DVDs that do not con-
form to the standard, and multisession CDs may
have limited playback or may notplay at all. Audi
recommends finalizing the recording process
when creating multisession CDs. Multisession
DVDs are not supported.

Using CDs/DVDs,the CD drive or the DVDdrive:
to ensurecorrect, high-quality playback and to

safety always depends on the informed and care-
ful driver.

For your safety and the safety of your passen-
gers, before driving always:

> Make surethat all lights and signals are operat-

ing correctly.

What impairs driving safety?

Safe driving is directly related to the condition of

the vehicle, the driver as well as the driver’s abili-
ty to concentrate on the road without being dis-
tracted.

The driver is responsible for the safety of the ve-
hicle and all of its occupants. If your ability to
drive is impaired, safety risks for everybody in the
vehicle increase and you also becomea hazard to
everyone else on the road > /\. Therefore:

> Do not let yourself be distracted by passengers

or by using a cellular telephone.

> NEVER drive when your driving ability is im-
paired (by medications, alcohol, drugs, etc.).
> Observeall traffic laws, rules of the road and

speed limits and plain common sense.

Drivers who are unbelted, out of position or
too close to the airbag can be seriously injured
by an airbag as it unfolds. To help reduce the
risk of serious personal injury:
— Always adjust the driver's seat and the

steering wheel so that there are at least
10 inches (25 cm) between your breastbone
and the steering wheel.

— Alwayshold the steering wheel on the out-

side of the steering wheel rim with your
hands at the 9 o'clock and 3 o'clock posi-
tions to help reduce the risk of personal in-
jury if the driver's airbag inflates.

— Never hold the steering wheel at the

12 o'clock position or with your hands at
other positions inside the steering wheel
rim or on the steering wheel hub. Holding
the steering wheel the wrong way can cause
serious injuries to the hands, arms and head
if the driver's airbag deploys.

  
 

— Alwayssit in an upright position and never
lean against or place any part of your body
too close to the area wherethe airbags are
located.

— Pointing the steering wheel toward your

face decreasesthe ability of the supplemen-
tal driver's airbag to protect you in a colli-
sion.

> Adjust the steering wheel so that thereis a dis-
tance of at least 10 inches (25 cm) between the
steering wheel and your breast bone >fig. 221.
If not possible, see your authorized Audi dealer
about adaptive equipment.

The proper front passenger seating position is
important for safe, relaxed driving.

For your own safety and to reduce the risk of in-
jury in the event of an accident, we recommend
that you adjust the seat for the front passenger
to the following position:

> Adjust the angle of the seatback so that it is in
an upright position and your back comes in full
contact with it whenever the vehicle is moving.
> Adjust the head restraint so the upper edge is

as even as possible with the top of your head. If
that is not possible, try to adjust the head re-
straint so that it is as close to this position as
possible > page 57.

> Keep both feet flat on the floor in front of the

front passenger seat.

> Fasten and wear safety belts correct-

ly> page 263.

seriously injured or killed by the airbag as it
unfolds. To help reduce the risk of serious per-

  sonal injury:

 

 

256

 

— Passengers mustalwayssit in an upright po-

sition and never lean against or place any
part of their body too close to the area
wherethe airbags are located.

— Passengers who are unbelted, out ofposi-
tion or too close to the airbag can be seri-
ously injured by an airbag as it unfolds with
great force in the blink of an eye.

— Always makesure that there are at least

10 inches (25 cm) between the front pas-
senger‘s breastbone and the instrument

Passengers who are improperly seated on the
rear seat can be seriously injured in a crash.
— Each passenger mustalwayssit on a seat of
their own and properly fasten and wear the
safety belt belonging to that seat.

— Safety belts only offer maximum protection
when the seatback is securely latched in the
upright position and the safety belts are
properly positioned on the body. By notsit-
ting upright, a rear seat passenger increases
the risk of personal injury from improperly
positioned safety belts!

— Always adjust the head restraint properly so

that it can give maximum protection.

 

 

The head restraints must be correctly adjusted to
achieve the best protection.

Pedal area

The pedals must always be free to move and
must neverbe interfered with by a floor mat or
any other object.

Makesurethat all pedals movefreely without in-
terference and that nothing prevents them from
returning to their original positions.

Only use floor mats that leave the pedal area free
and can be secured with floor mat fasteners.

If a brake circuit fails, increased brake pedal trav-
el is required to bring the vehicle to a full stop.

 ZA WARNING

Pedals that cannot movefreely can cause loss
of vehicle control and increase the risk ofseri-
ous injury.
— Never place any objects in the driver's foot-
well. An object could get into the pedal area
and interfere with pedal function. In case of
sudden braking or an accident, you would
not be able to brake or accelerate!

 
  

— Always makesure that nothing can fall or

moveinto the driver's footwell.

 

— Never attempt to adjust head restraint while

driving. If you have driven off and must ad-

Examples of improper seating positions

The occupant restraint system can only reduce
the risk of injury if vehicle occupants are properly
seated.

Improper seating positions can cause serious in-
jury or death. Safety belts can only work when
they are properly positioned on the body. Im-
proper seating positions reduce the effectiveness
of safety belts and will even increase the risk of
injury and death by moving the safety belt to crit-
ical areas of the body. Improper seating positions
also increase the risk of serious injury and death
when an airbag deploys and strikes an occupant
who is not in the proper seating position. A driver
is responsible for the safetyof all vehicle occu-
pants and especially for children. Therefore:

> Never allow anyone to assume an incorrect

seating position when the vehicle is being used
>.

The following bulletins list only some sample po-
sitions that will increase the risk of serious injury
and death. Our hope is that these examples will
make you more awareof seating positions that
are dangerous.

Therefore, whenever the vehicle is moving:

— never stand up in the vehicle

— never stand on the seats

— never kneel on the seats

— never ride with the seatback reclined

— never lie down on the seats
— never lean up against the instrument panel
— never sit on the edge of the seat

— never sit sideways

— never lean out the window
— never put your feet out the window

Use only floor mats that leave the pedal area un-
obstructed and that are firmly secured so that
they cannotslip out of position. You can obtain
suitable floor mats from your authorized Audi
dealer.

Floor mat fasteners are installed in your Audi.

Floor mats used in your vehicle must be attached
to these fasteners. Properly securing the floor
mats will prevent them from sliding into posi-
tions that could interfere with the pedals or im-
pair safe operation of your vehicle in other ways.

 ZA WARNING

Pedals that cannot movefreely can result ina

serious personal injury.
— Always makesure that floor mats are prop-

erly secured.

— Never placeor install floor mats or other

floor coverings in the vehicle that cannot be
properly secured in place to prevent them
from slipping and interfering with the ped-
als or the ability to control the vehicle.

— Never place or install floor mats or other
floor coverings on top of already installed
floor mats. Additional floor mats and other
coverings will reduce the size of the pedal
area and interfere with the pedals.

— Alwaysproperly reinstall and secure floor

mats that have been taken out for cleaning.
— Always makesure that objects cannotfall in-

Fig. 225 The vehicle crashesinto the wall

The physical principles are simple. Both the vehi-
cle and the passengers possess energy which var-
ies with vehicle speed and body weight. Engi-
neers call this energy “kinetic energy.”

The higher the speed of the vehicle and the
greater the vehicle's weight, the more energy
that has to be “absorbed”in the crash.

Vehicle speed is the most significant factor. If the
speed doubles from 15 to 30 mph (25 to 50
km/h), the energy increases 4 times!

 

Becausethe passengersofthis vehicle are not us-
ing safety belts > fig. 224, they will keep moving
at the same speed the vehicle was moving just

Fig. 226 A driver not wearing a safety belt is violently

forward and strike the driver

before the crash, until something stops them —
here, the wall > fig. 225.

The same principles apply to people sitting ina
vehicle that is involved in a frontal collision. Even
at city speeds of 20 to 30 mph (30 to 50 km/h),
the forces acting on the body can reach one ton
(2,000 lbs. or 1,000 kg) or more. At greater
speeds, these forces are even higher.

What happens to occupants not wearing
Cr laallieya

People who do notuse safety belts are also not
attached to their vehicle. In a frontal collision
they will also keep moving forward at the speed
their vehicle was travelling just before the crash.
Of course, the laws of physics don't just apply to
frontal collisions, they determine what happens
in all kinds of accidents and collisions.

In crashes unbelted occupants cannot stop
themselves from flying forward and being in-
jured or killed. Always wear yoursafety belts!

261  >

Unbelted occupants are not able toresist the tre-
mendous forces of impact by holding tight or

Safety belts

 

bracing themselves. Without the benefit of safe-

ty restraint systems, the unrestrained occupant
will slam violently into the steering wheel, in-
strument panel, windshield, or whatever elseis
in the way > fig. 226. This impact with the vehi-
cle interior has all the energy they had just before
the crash.

Safety belts used properly can makea big differ-
ence. Safety belts help to keep passengersin
their seats, gradually reduce energylevels ap-
plied to the body in an accident, and help prevent
the uncontrolled movement that can causeseri-
ous injuries. In addition, safety belts reduce the
danger of being thrown out ofthe vehicle.

Never rely on airbags alone for protection. Even
when they deploy, airbags provide only additional
protection. Airbags are not supposed to deployin
all kinds of accidents. Although your Audi is
equipped with airbags, all vehicle occupants, in-
cluding the driver, must wear safety belts cor-
rectly in order to minimize the risk of severe in-
jury or death in a crash.

Safety belts attach passengers to the car and give
them the benefit of being slowed down more
gently or “softly” through the “give” in the safety
belts, crush zones and other safety features engi-
neered into today's vehicles. By “absorbing” the
kinetic energy over a longer period of time, the
safety belts make the forces on the body more
“tolerable” and less likely to cause injury.

Remember too,that airbags will deploy only once
and that your safety belts are always there to of-
fer protection in those accidents in which airbags
are not supposed to deploy or when theyhaveal-
ready deployed. Unbelted occupants can also be
thrown out of the vehicle where even more severe
or fatal injuries can occur.

It is also important for the rear passengers to
wear safety belts correctly. Unbelted passengers
in the rear seats endanger not only themselves
but also the driver and other passengers
=> fig. 227. In a frontal collision they will be
thrown forward violently, where they can hit and
injure the driver and/or front seat passenger.

Sila ol heM gela-las
 

Peoplethinkit's possible to use the hands to
brace the body in a minor collision. It's simply
not true!

Although these examplesare based ona frontal
collision, safety belts can also substantially re-
duce the risk of injury in other kinds of crashes.
So, whether you're on a long trip or just going to
the corner store, always buckle up and make sure
others do, too. Accident statistics show that vehi-
cle occupants properly wearing safety belts have
a lower risk of being injured and a much better
chance of surviving an accident. Properly using
safety belts also greatly increases the ability of
the supplemental airbags to do their job in a col-
lision. For this reason, wearing a safety belt is le-
gally required in most countries including much
of the United States and Canada.

Although your Audi is equipped with airbags, you
still have to wear the safety belts provided. Front
airbags, for example, are activated only in some
frontal collisions. The front airbags are notacti-
vatedin all frontal collisions, in side and rear col-
lisions, in rollovers or in cases wherethere is not
enough deceleration through impactto the front
of the vehicle. The same goes for the other airbag
systems in your Audi. So, always wear your safety
belt and make sure everybodyin your vehicleis
properly restrained!

Important information

Importance of wearing safety belts and
sitting properly

Airbags are only supplemental restraints. For
airbags to do theirjob, occupants must always
properly weartheir safety belts and be in a prop-
er seating position.

For your safety and the safety of your passen-
gers, before driving off, always:

> Adjust the driver's seat and steering wheel

properly > page 255,

> Adjust the front passenger's seat properly

=> page 256,

> Wear safety belts properly > page 263,
> Always properly use the proper child restraint

to protect children > page 290.

Ina collision, airbags mustinflate within the
blink of an eye and with considerable force. The
supplemental airbags can cause injuries if the
driver or the front seat passenger is not seated
properly. Therefore in order to help the airbag to
do its job, it is important, both as a driver and as
a passenger to sit properlyat all times.

By keeping room between your body and the
steering wheel and the front of the passenger
compartment,the airbag can inflate fully and
completely and provide supplemental protection
in certain frontal collisions > page 255, Correct
passenger seating positions. For details on the
operation of the seat adjustment controls
=> page 53.

It's especially important that children are proper-
ly restrained > page 290.

There is a lot that the driver and the passengers
can and must do to help the individual safety fea-
tures installed in your Audi work together as a
system.

Proper seating position is important so that the
front airbag on the driver side can do its job. If
you have a physical impairment or condition that
prevents you from sitting properly on the driver
seat with the safety belt properly fastened and

268

reaching the pedals, or if you have concerns with
regard to the function or operation of the Ad-
vanced Airbag System, please contact your au-
thorized Audi dealer or qualified workshop, or
call Audi Customer Relations at 1-800-822-2834
for possible modifications to your vehicle.

When the airbag system deploys, a gas generator
will fill the airbags, break open the padded cov-
ers, and inflate between the steering wheel and
the driver and between the instrument panel and
the front passenger. The airbags will deflate im-
mediately after deployment so that the front oc-
cupants can see through the windshield again
without interruption.

All of this takes place in the blink of an eye, so
fast that many people don't even realize that the
airbags have deployed. The airbags also inflate
with a great deal of force and nothing should be
in their way when they deploy. Front airbags in
combination with properly worn safety belts slow
downand limit the occupant's forward move-
ment. Together they help to prevent the driver
and front seat passenger from hitting parts of
the inside of the vehicle while reducing the forces
acting on the occupant during the crash. In this
way they help to reducethe risk ofinjury to the
head and upper bodyin the crash. Airbags do not
protect the arms or the lower parts of the body.

Both front airbags will notinflate in all frontal
collisions. The triggering of the airbag system de-
pends on the vehicle deceleration rate caused by
the collision and registered by the electronic con-
trol unit. If this rate is below the reference value
programmed into the control unit, the airbags
will not be triggered, even though the car may be
badly damaged as a result of the collision. Vehi-
cle damage, repair costs or even the lack of vehi-
cle damage is not necessarily an indication of
whether an airbag should inflate or not.

Since the circumstances will vary considerably

between one collision and another,it is not possi-
ble to define a range of vehicle speeds that will
cover every possible kind and angle of impact
that will always trigger the airbags. Important
factors include, for example, the nature (hard or
soft) of the object which the car hits, the angle of
impact, vehicle speed, etc. The front airbags will >

 

Airbag system

also not inflate in side or rear collisions, or in roll-

overs.

Always remember: Airbags will deploy only once,
and only in certain kinds ofcollisions. Your safety
belts are always thereto offer protection in those
situations in which airbags are not supposed to
deploy, or when they have already deployed; for
example, when your vehicle strikes or is struck by
another vehicle after the first collision.

This is just one of the reasons whyan airbag is a
supplementary restraint and is not a substitute
for a safety belt. The airbag system works most
effectively when used with the safety belts.
Therefore, always properly wear your safety belts
=> page 260.

 ZA WARNING
Sitting too close to the steering wheel or in-
strumentpanel will decrease the effective-
ness of the airbags and will increase the risk
of personal injury in a collision.

— Never sit closer than 10 inches (25 cm) to

the steering wheel or instrument panel.

— If you cannotsit more than 10 inches

(25 cm) from the steering wheel, investi-
gate whether adaptive equipment may be
available to help you reach the pedals and
increase your seating distance from the
steering wheel.

— All vehicle occupants and especially children
mustbe restrained properly whenever riding
in a vehicle. An unrestrained or improperly
restrained child could be injured by striking
the interior or by being ejected from the ve-
hicle during a sudden maneuver or impact.
An unrestrained or improperly restrained
child is also at greater risk of injury or death
through contact with an inflating airbag.

there is a small child or child restraint on the

Even though your vehicle is equipped with an Ad-
vanced Airbag System, makecertain that all chil-
dren, especially those 12 years and younger,al-
ways ride in the back seat properly restrained for
their age and size. The airbag on the passenger
side makes the front seat a potentially dangerous
place for a child to ride. The front seat is not the
safest place for a child in a forward-facing child
safety seat. It can be a very dangerous place for
an infant or a child in a rearward-facing seat.

The Advanced Airbag System in your vehicle has
been certified to comply with the requirements
of United States Federal Motor Vehicle Safety
Standard (FMVSS) 208, as well as Canada Motor

Vehicle Safety Standard (CMVSS) 208 as applica-
ble at the time your vehicle was manufactured.
According to requirements, the front Advanced
Airbag System on the passenger side has been
certified for “suppression”for infants of about
12 month old and younger and for “low risk de-
ployment”for children aged 3 to 6 yearsold (as
defined in the standard).

The PASSENGER AIR BAGOFF 3%;light in the
headliner tells you when the front Advanced Air-
bag on the passenger side has been turned off by
the electronic control unit.

Each time you turn on the ignition, the PASSEN-
GER AIR BAGOFF #¥; ON @ light will come on
for a few seconds and:

— PASSENGER AIR BAG OFF 3; will come on if

the front passenger seat is not occupied

— PASSENGER AIR BAG OFF 3; will come on if

the electrical capacitance measured by the ca-
pacitive passenger detection system for the
front passenger seat equals the combined ca-
pacitance of an infant up to about one year of
age and one of the rearward-facing or forward-
facing child restraints listed in Federal Motor
Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 208 with
which the Advanced Airbag System in your vehi-
cle was certified. For a listing of the child re-
straints that were used to certify your vehicle's

the Advanced Airbag System in your vehicle was
certified.

If the total electrical capacitance registered on
the front passenger seat is more than thatof a
typical 1 year-old child but less than the weight
of a small adult, the front airbag on the passen-
ger side can deploy (the PASSENGER AIR BAG

If the PASSENGER AIR BAGOFF #;light does
not come on, the front airbag on the passenger
side has not been turnedoff by the electronic
control unit and can deployif the control unit
senses an impact that meets the conditions stor-
ed in its memory.

For example, the airbag may deployif:

—asmallchild that is heavier than a typical 1

year-old child is on the front passenger seat (re-
gardless of whether the child is in one of the

—a child who has outgrown child restraints is on

the front passenger seat.

If the front passenger airbag is turned off, the

Your vehicle is equipped with an “Advanced Air-
bag System” in compliance with United States
Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard
(FMVSS) 208, as well as Canada Motor Vehicle
Safety Standard (CMVSS) 208 as applicable at
the time your vehicle was manufactured.

The airbag for the driver is in the steering wheel
hub > fig. 234 and the airbag for the front pas-
senger is in the instrument panel > fig. 235. The
general location of the airbags is marked “AIR-
BAG”.

There is a lot you need to know aboutthe airbags
in your vehicle. We urge you to read the detailed
information about airbags, safety belts and child
safety in this and the other chapters that make
up the owner's literature. Please be sure to heed
the WARNINGS- they are extremely important
for your safety and the safety of your passengers,
especially infants and small children.

 ZA WARNING

Never rely on airbags alone for protection.
— Even when they deploy, airbags provide only

supplemental protection.

— Airbag work mosteffectively when used

with properly worn safety belts.

— Therefore, always wear your safety belts and

make sure that everybody in your vehicleis
properly restrained.

— Alwayshold the steering wheel with both

hands on the outside of the steering wheel
rim at the 9:00 o'clock and 3:00 o'clock po-
sitions to help reduce the risk of personal in-
jury if the driver's airbag inflates.

 
 
 

 

 

Airbag system

 

— Never hold the steering wheel at the 12
o'clock position or with your hands any-
whereinside the steering wheel or on the
steering wheel hub. Holding the steering
wheel the wrong wayincreases the risk of
severe injury to the arms, hands, and head if
the driver airbag deploys.

 

 

Z\ WARNING
Objects between you and the airbag will in-
crease the risk of injury in a crash byinterfer-
ing with the way the airbag unfolds and/or by
being pushedinto you as the airbag inflates.
— Always makesure nothing is in the frontair-

bag deployment zone that could be struck
by the airbag when it inflates.

— Objects in the zone of a deploying airbag can
become projectiles when the airbag deploys
and causeserious personal injury.

— Never hold things in your hands or on your

lap when the vehicleis in use.

— Never place accessories or other objects

— Never attach objects to the windshield

above the passenger front airbag, such as
accessory GPS navigation units or music

(such as cup holders, telephone brackets,
note pads, navigation systems,or things
that are large, heavy, or bulky) on the doors;
never attach them to the doorsor the wind-
shield; never place them over or near or at-
tach them to the area marked ,,AIRBAG“ on

ZA WARNING

A person on the front passenger seat, espe-

cially infants and small children, will receive
serious injuries and can even be killed by be-
ing too close to the airbag when it inflates.
— Although the Advanced Airbag System in

your vehicle is designed to turn off the front
passenger airbag if an infant or a small child
is on the front passenger seat, nobody can
absolutely guarantee that deployment un-
der these special conditions is impossible in
all conceivable situations that may happen
during the useful life of your vehicle.

— The Advanced Airbag System can deploy in
accordancewiththe ,,low risk“ option for 3-
and 6-year-old children under the U.S. Fed-
eral Standard if a child with electrical capac-
itance greater than the combined capaci-
tance of a typical one-year old infant re-
strained in one of the forward facing or rear-
ward-facing child seats with which your ve-
hicle was certified is on the front passenger
seat and the other conditions for airbag de-
ployment are met.

Advanced front airbag system

Your vehicle is equipped with a front Advanced
Airbag System in compliance with United States
Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS)

208, as well as Canada Motor Vehicle Safety

Standard (CMVSS) 208 as applicable at the time
your vehicle was manufactured.

The front Advanced Airbag System supplements
the safety belts to provide additional protection
for the driver's and front passenger's heads and
upper bodies in frontal crashes. The airbags in-
flate only in frontal impacts when the vehicle de-
celeration is high enough.

Airbag system

 

The front Advanced Airbag System for the front
seat occupantsis not a substitute for your safety
belts. Rather,it is part of the overall occupant re-
straint system in your vehicle. Always remember
that the airbag system can only help to protect
you, if you are sitting upright, wearing your safe-
ty belt and wearing it properly. This is why you
and your passengers must always be properly re-
strained, not just because the law requires you to
be.

The Advanced Airbag System in your vehicle has
been certified to meet the “low risk” require-
mentsfor 3 and 6 year-old children on the pas-
senger side and very small adults on the driver
side. The low risk deployment criteria are intend-
ed to help reduce the risk of injury through inter-
action with the front airbag that can occur,for
example, by being too close to the steering wheel
and instrument panel when the airbag inflates.

In addition, the system has been certified to
comply with the “suppression” requirements of
the Safety Standard, to turn off the front airbag
for infants 12 months old and younger who are
restrained on the front passenger seat in child re-
straints that are listed in the Standard
=> page 292, Child restraints and AdvancedAir-
bags.

“Suppression” requires the front airbag on the
passenger side to be turned off if:

—a child up to about one year of age is restrained

on the front passenger seat in one ofthe rear-
facing or forward-facing infant restraintslisted
in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208
with which the Advanced Airbag System in your
vehicle was certified. For a listing of the child
restraints that were used to certify your vehi-
cle's compliance with the US Safety Standard
=> page 292,

— Whena person is detected on the front passen-
ger seat that has an electrical capacitance that
is more than the total electrical capacitance of
a child that is about 1 year old restrained in one
of the rear-facing or forward-facing infant re-
straints(listed in Federal Motor Vehicle Safety
Standard 208 with which the Advanced Airbag
System in your vehicle was certified), the front

274

airbag on the passenger side may or may not
deploy.

The PASSENGER AIR BAG OFF #; light comes on
when the electronic control unit detects a total
electrical capacitance on the front passenger seat
that requires the front airbag to be turnedoff. If
the PASSENGER AIR BAGOFF 3;light does not
come on, the front airbag on the passenger side
has not been turned off by the control unit and
can deployif the control unit senses an impact
that meets the conditions stored in its memory.

If the total electrical capacitance registered on
the front passenger seat is more than that of a
typical 1 year-old, but less than the weight of a
small adult, the front airbag on the passenger
side may deploy (the PASSENGER AIR BAG OFF
8%; light does not come on).

For example, the airbag may deployif:

—asmall child that is heavier than a typical 1

year-old child is on the front passenger seat (re-
gardless of whether the child is in one of the
child safety seats listed > page 292),

—a child who has outgrown child restraints is on

the front passenger seat.

If the front passenger airbag is turned off, the
PASSENGER AIR BAGOFF #;light in the head-
liner will come on and stay on.

If the front passenger airbag deploys, the Federal
Standard requires the airbag to meet the “low
risk” deployment criteria to help reduce the risk
of injury through interaction with the airbag.
“Low risk” deployment occurs in those crashes
that take place at lower decelerations as defined
in the electronic control unit. > page 280

Always remember: Even though your vehicle is
equipped with Advanced Airbags, the safest place
for children is properly restrained on the back
seat. Please be sure to read the important infor-
mation in the sections that follow and be sure to
heed all of the WARNINGS.

the seat may prevent the Advanced Airbag Sys-
tem for the front passenger seat from doing its
job ina crash.

The front Advanced Airbag System consists
of the following:

— Crash sensorsin the front of the vehicle that
measurevehicle acceleration/deceleration to
provide information to the Advanced Airbag
System about the severity of the crash.

— An electronic control unit, with integrated

crash sensorsfor front and side impacts. The
control unit “decides” whether tofire the front
airbags based on the information received from
the crash sensors. The control unit also “de-
cides” whether the safety belt pretensioners
should be activated.

— An Advanced Airbag with gas generator and

control valve for the driver inside the steering
wheel hub.

— An Advanced Airbag with gas generator and
control valve inside the instrument panel for
the front passenger.

— A capacitive passenger detection system under-

neath the front passenger seat cover. This sys-
tem measures the electrical capacitance of the
person in the seat. The information registered
is sent continuously to the electronic control
unit to regulate deployment ofthe front Ad-
vanced Airbag on the passenger side.

— An airbag monitoring system and indicator

light Ea in the instrument cluster.

—Asensor in each front seat registers the dis-

tance between the respective seat and the
steering wheel or instrument panel. The infor-
mation registered is sent continuously to the
electronic control unit to regulate deployment
of the front Advanced Airbags.

ZA WARNING

Damage to the front passenger seat can pre-
vent the front airbag from working properly.
— Improper repair or disassembly of the front

passenger and driver seat will prevent the
Advanced Airbag System from functioning
properly.

— Repairs to the front passenger seat must be
performed by qualified and properly trained
workshop personnel.

— Never remove the front passenger or driver

seat from the vehicle.

— Never removethe upholstery from the front

Passenger Seat.

— Never disassemble or remove parts from the

seat or disconnect wires from it.

— Never carry sharp objects in your pockets or
put them on the seat. The capacitive passen-
ger detection mat in the front passenger
seat will not function properlyif it is punc-
tured.

— Never carry things on your lap or carry ob-
jects on the front passenger seat. Such ob-
jects can influence the capacitance regis-
tered by the capacitive passenger detection
system, so that incorrect information is pro-
vided to the airbag control unit.

How the Advanced Airbag System
components work together

The front Advanced Airbag System and the side
airbags supplement the protection offered by the
front three-point safety belts and the adjustable
head restraints to help reduce the risk of injury in
a wide range of accident and crash situations. Be
sure to read the important information about
safety and heed the WARNINGS in this chapter.

Deployment of the Advanced Airbag System and
the activation of the safety belt pretensioners de-
pend on the deceleration measured by the crash
sensors and registered by the electronic control
unit. Crash severity depends on speed and decel-
eration as well as the mass and stiffness of the
vehicle or object involved in the crash.

On the passenger side, regardless of safety belt
use, the front passenger frontal airbag will be
turned off if the electrical capacitance measured
by the capacitive passenger detection system on
the front passenger seat is less than the amount
programmed in the electronic control unit. The
front passenger frontal airbag will also be turned
off if the capacitance measured by the system for
the front passenger seat equals that of an infant
of about one year of age in one ofthe child seats
that was used to certify the Advanced Airbag Sys-
tem under Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard
208. The PASSENGER AIR BAGOFF %;light
comes on and stays on to tell you when the front
Advanced Airbag System on the passenger side
has been turned off > page 280.

 ZA WARNING
To reduce the risk of injury when an airbag in-
flates, always wear safety belts properly.
— If you are unrestrained, leaning forward, sit-

ting sidewaysor out of position in any way,
your risk of injury is much higher.

Fig. 236 Inflated front airbags

Safety belts are important to help keep front seat
occupantsin the proper seated position so that
airbags can unfold properly and provide supple-
mental protection in a frontal collision.

The front airbags are designed to provide addi-
tional protection for the chest and face of the
driver and the front seat passenger when:

— safety belts are worn properly
— the seats have been positioned so that the oc-

cupant is properly seated as far as possible
from the airbag

— and the head restraints have been properly ad-

justed

Because airbags inflate in the blink of an eye with
great force, things you have on your lap or have
placed on the seat could become dangerous pro-
jectiles, and be pushedinto you if the airbag in-
flates.

When an airbag deploys,fine dust is released.
This is normal and is not caused bya fire in the
vehicle. This dust is made up mostly of a powder
used to lubricate the airbags as they deploy.It
could irritate skin.

It is important to remember that while the sup-
plemental airbag system is designed to reduce
the likelihood of serious injuries, other injuries,
for example swelling, bruising and minor abra-
sions, can also happen when airbags inflate. Air-
bags do not protect the arms or the lower parts

 

278

of the body. Front airbags supplement the three-
point safety belts only in some frontal collisions
in which the vehicle deceleration is high enough
to deploy the airbags.

Front airbags will not deploy:

— if the ignition is switched off when a crash oc-

curs

— in side collisions
—in rear-end collisions
— in rollovers
— when the crash deceleration measured by the

airbag system is less than the minimum thresh-
old needed for airbag deployment as registered
by the electronic control unit

The front passenger airbag also will not
deploy:

—when the front passenger seat is not occupied,

— when the electrical capacitance measured by

the capacitive passenger detection system for
the front passenger seat indicates that the pas-
senger side frontal airbag must be switched off
by the electronic control unit (the PASSENGER
AIR BAG OFF #; light > page 280 comes on
and stays on).

 

ZA WARNING

Sitting in the wrong position can increase the
risk of serious injury in crashes.
—To reducethe risk of injury when the airbags

inflate, the driver and passengers must al-
wayssit in an upright position, must not
lean against or place any part of their body
too close to the area wherethe airbags are
located.

 

— Occupants who are unbelted, out ofposition
or too close to the airbag can beseriously in-
jured by an airbag as it unfolds with great
force in the blink of an eye > page 269.

 
  

 ZX WARNING
A child in a rearward-facing child safety seat
installed on the front passenger seatwill be
seriously injured and can be killedif the front
airbag inflates - even with an Advanced Airbag
System.

 

Airbag system

 

— The inflating airbag will hit the child safety

seat or infant carrier with great force and
will smash the child safety seat and child
against the backrest, center armrest, door
or roof.

— Alwaysinstall rear-facing child safety seats

on the rear seat.

— If you mustinstall a rearward-facing child
safety seat on the front passenger seat be-
cause of exceptional circumstances and the
PASSENGERAIR BAG OFF %; light does not
come on and stay on, immediately install
the rear-facing child safety seat in a rear
seating position and have the airbag system
inspected by your authorized Audi dealer.

 

 

ZA WARNING
Objects between you and the airbag will in-
crease the risk of injury in a crash by interfer-
ing with the way the airbag unfolds or by be-
ing pushed into you as the airbag inflates.
— Never hold things in your hands or on your

lap when the vehicleis in use.

— Never transport items on or in the area of

ger seat could cause the capacitive sensor in
the seat to signal to airbag system that the
seat is occupied by a person when it in factis

not, or that the person on the seatis heavier
than he or she actually is. The change in
electric capacitance because of such objects
can cause the passenger front airbag to be
turned on when it should be off, or can
cause the airbag to work in a waythat is dif-
ferent from the way it would have worked
without objects on the seat.

— Always makesure that there is nothing on

the front passenger seat that will cause the
capacitive passenger detection system in
the seat to signal to the Airbag System that
the seat is occupied by a person when it is
not, or to signal that it is occupied by some-
one who is heavier than the person actually
sitting on the seat. The presence of an ob-
ject could cause the passenger front airbag
to be turned on when it shouldbe off, or
could cause the airbag to work in a way that
is different from the way it would have
worked without the object on the seat.

 

— Never place or attach accessories or other

objects (such as cupholders, telephone
brackets, large, heavy or bulky objects) on
the doors, over or near the area marked

Repair, care and disposal of the airbags

Parts of the airbag system are installed at many
different places on your Audi. Installing, remov-
ing, servicing or repairing a part in an area of the
vehicle can damage a part of an airbag system
and prevent that system from working properly
ina collision.

There are some important things you have to
know to makesurethat the effectiveness of the
system will not be impaired and that discarded
componentsdo not cause injury or pollute the
environment.

 ZA WARNING

Improper care, servicing and repair proce-
dures can increase the risk of personal injury
and death by preventing an airbag from de-
ploying when needed or deploying an airbag
unexpectedly:

— Never cover, obstruct, or change the steer-

ing wheel horn pad or airbag cover or the in-
strument panel or modify them in any way.

 
  

— Never attach any objects such as cupholders
or telephone mountings to the surfaces cov-
ering the airbag units.

— For cleaning the horn pad or instrument

panel, use only a soft, dry cloth or one mois-
tened with plain water. Solvents or cleaners
could damage the airbag cover or change
the stiffness or strength of the material so
that the airbag cannot deploy and protect
properly.

— Never repair, adjust, or change anyparts of

the airbag system.

— All work on the steering wheel, instrument

panel, front seatsor electrical system (in-
cluding the installation of audio equipment,
cellular telephones and CB radios,etc.)
must be performed by a qualified technician
who has the training and special equipment
necessary.

— For any work on the airbag system, we

strongly recommend that you see your au-
thorized Audi dealer or qualified workshop.
— Never modify the front bumper or parts of

the vehicle body.

— Always makesurethat the side airbag can

inflate without interference:

— The airbag system can deploy only once. Af-
ter an airbag has been deployed, it must be
replaced with new replacement parts de-
signed and approved especially for your Audi

combinations not approved by Audi, lowering the
vehicle, changing the stiffness of the suspension,
including the springs, suspension struts, shock

the changes had not been made. Other kinds of
changes may reduce the force levels measured by
the sensors and prevent the airbag from deploy-

— the electronic control module and external side

impact sensors

— the twoside airbags located in the sides of the

front backrests

— tworear side airbags*
— the airbag warning light in the instrumentclus-

ter.

The airbag system is monitored electronically to
makecertain thatit is functioning properly at all
times. Each time you turn on the ignition, the air-
bag system indicator light will come on for a few
seconds (self diagnostics).

 Z\WARNING
Changing the vehicle's suspension including
use of unapprovedtire-rim combinations can
change Advanced Airbag performance and in-
crease the risk of serious personal injury in a
crash.
— Never install suspension components that
do not have the same performance charac-
teristics as the componentsoriginally instal-
led on your vehicle.

 
  

— Never usetire-rim combinations that have

not been approved by Audi.

Airbag system

The side airbag system supplements the safety
belts and can help to reduce the risk of injury to
the driver's, front and rear* passenger's upper
torso on the side of the vehicle that is struck in a
side collision. The airbag deploys only in side im-
pacts and only when the vehicle acceleration reg-
istered by the control unit is high enough. If this
rate is below the reference value programmed in-
to the control unit, the side airbags will not be
triggered, even though the car may be badly
damagedasa result of the collision. It is not pos-
sible to define an airbag triggering range that
will cover every possible angle of impact, since
the circumstances will vary considerably between
one collision and another. Important factorsin-
clude, for example, the nature (hard or soft) of
the impacting object, the angle of impact, vehicle
speed, etc. > page 286, Important safetyin-
structions on the side airbag system.

Aside from their normal safety function, safety
belts work to help keep the driver or front pas-
senger in position in the event ofa side collision
so that the side airbags can provide protection.

The airbag system is not a substitute for your
safety belt. Rather, it is part of the overall occu-
pant restraint system in your vehicle. Always re-
member that the side airbag system can only

help to protect you if you are wearing your safety
belt and wearing it properly. This is another rea-
son why you should always wear your safety
belts, not just because the law requires you to do
so > page 260, General information.

It is important to remember that while the sup-
plemental side airbag system is designed to re-
duce the likelihood of serious injuries, other inju-

ries, for example, swelling, bruising, friction
burns and minor abrasions can also be associated
with deployed side airbags. Remember too, side
airbags will deploy only once and only in certain
kinds of accidents - your safety belts are always

there to offer protection.

Vehicle damage, repair costs or even the lack of
vehicle damage are not necessarily an indication
of over-sensitive or failed airbag activation. In
some collisions, both front and side airbags may
inflate. Remember too, that airbags will deploy
only once and onlyin certain kinds of collisions -

your safety belts are always there to offer protec-
tion in those accidents in which airbags are not
supposed to deploy or when they have already
deployed.

The side airbag system will not deploy:

— when the ignition is turned off

— in side collisions when the acceleration meas-

ured by the sensor is too low

— in front-end collisions

—in rear-end collisions

—in rollovers.

In some types of accidents the front airbags, side
curtain airbags and side airbags maybe triggered
together.

 Z\WARNING
— Safety belts and the airbag system will only

provide protection when occupantsare in

the proper seating position > page 286.

— If the airbag indicator light > page 22

comes when the vehicle is being used, have
the system inspected immediately by your
authorized Audi dealer. It is possible that
the airbag will inflate when it is not sup-
posed to, or will not inflate when it should.

 

How supplemental side airbags work

 

Side airbags deploy instantly and can help re-
ducethe risk of upper torso injuries for occu-
pants who are properly restrained.

Fig. 240 Side curtain airbags, driver's side: location

The side curtain airbags are located on both sides
of the interior above the front and rear side win-
dows © fig. 240.

The side curtain airbags contain features that
provide ejection mitigation to help prevent vehi-
cle occupantsor parts of their bodies from being
completely or partially ejected from the vehicle
interior in certain side impacts and vehicle roll-
overs.

The side curtain airbag system supplements the
safety belts and can help to reducethe risk ofin-
jury for occupants’ heads and upper torso ina
side collision. The side curtain airbag inflates in
side impacts and only when the vehicle accelera-
tion registered by the control unit is high enough.
If this rate is below the reference value program-
med into the control unit, the side curtain airbag
will not be triggered, even though the car may be
badly damaged as a result ofthe collision. It is
not possible to define an airbag triggering range
that will cover every possible angle of impact,
since the circumstances will vary considerably be-
tween one collision and another. Important fac-

tors include, for example, the nature (hard or

Child safety

Important information

Introduction

The rear seat is generally the safest place ina
collision.

The physical principles of what happens when
your vehicleis in a crash applyalso to children
= page 261, What happens to occupants not
wearing safety belts?. But unlike adults and
teenagers, their muscles and bonesare not fully
developed. In many respects children are at
greater risk of serious injury in crashes than
adults.

Because children's bodies are notfully developed,
they require restraint systems especially de-
signed for their size, weight, and body structure.
Many countries and all states of the United
States and provinces of Canada havelawsrequir-
ing the use of approved child restraint systems
for infants and small children.

Ina frontal crash at a speed of 20 - 35 mph (30 -
56 km/h)the forces acting on a 13-pound (6 kg)
infant will be more than 20 times the weight of
the child. This means the weight of the child
would suddenly be more than 260 pounds
(120 kg). Under these conditions, only an appro-
priate child restraint properly used can reduce
the risk of serious injury. Child restraints, like
adult safety belts, must be used properly to be
effective. Used improperly, they can increase the
risk of serious injury in an accident.

All children, especially those 12 years and young-
er must alwaysride in the back seat properlyre-
strained for their age and size. If you mustinstall
a child restraint on the front passenger seat in
exceptional circumstances, be sure to read and
heed the important information and warnings
= page 269. Infants and other children who are
properly restrained in an appropriate child re-
straint that is for their size and age can benefit
from the protection that supplemental side air-
bags provide in some kinds of crashes.

For more information please see information pro-
vided by the:

290

— National HighwayTraffic Safety Administration
(NHTSA), currently at : http://www.safercar.gov
(for the USA)

— Transport Canada Information Centre, currently

at: http://www.tc.gc.ca (for Canada)

Consult the child safety seat manufacturer's in-
structions in order to be sure the seat is right for
your child's size > page 294, Important safety
instructions for using child safety seats. Please
be sure to read and heed all of the important in-
formation and WARNINGS about child safety, Ad-

vanced Airbags, and the installation of child re-
straints in this chapter.

There is a lot you need to know about the Ad-
vanced Airbags in your vehicle and how they work
when infants and children in child restraints are
on the front passenger seat. Becauseof the large
amountof important information, we cannotre-
peat it all here. We urge you to read the detailed
information in this owner's manual about airbags
and the Advanced Airbag System in your vehicle
and the very important information about trans-
porting children on the front passenger seat.
Please be sure to heed the WARNINGS- they are
extremely important for your safety and the safe-
ty of your passengers, especially infants and
small children.

 ZA WARNING
— Accident statistics have shownthat children
are generally safer in the rear seat area than
in the front seating position. Always restrain
any child age 12 and under in the rear.

— All vehicle occupants and especially children
mustbe restrained properly whenever riding
in a vehicle. An unrestrained or improperly
restrained child could be injured by striking
the interior or by being ejected from the ve-
hicle during a sudden maneuver or impact.
An unrestrained or improperly restrained
child is also at greater risk of injury or death
through contact with an inflating airbag.

 
  

—Asuitable child restraint properly installed

and usedat one ofthe rear seating positions
provides the highest degree of protection
for infants and small children in mostacci-
dentsituations.

on the rear seat.

— If you mustinstall a rearward facing child
safety seat on the front passenger seat in
exceptional circumstances and the PASSEN-
GER AIR BAG OFF #; light does not come on
and stay on, immediately install the rear-
facing child safety seat in a rear seating po-
sition and have the airbag system inspected
immediately by your Audi dealer.

— Always movethe front passenger seat to
the highest position in the up and down
adjustment range and moveit back to the
rearmostposition in the seat's fore and aft
adjustment range, as far away from the
airbag as possible, before installing the
forward-facing child restraint.

— Always makesurethat the safety belt up-
per anchorage is behind the child restraint
and not next to or in front of the child re-
straint so that the safety belt will be prop-
erly positioned.

— Always makesure that nothing prevents

the front passenger's seat from being
moved to the rearmostposition in its fore
and aft adjustment range.

 

— If exceptional circumstances require the use

of a forward-facing child restraint on the
front passenger's seat, the child's safety and
well-being require the following special pre-
cautions to be taken:

— Forward-facing child seats installed on the
front passenger seat mayinterfere with the
deployment of the airbag and cause serious
personal injury to the child.

Even though your vehicle is equipped with an Ad-
vanced Airbag system, all children, especially
those 12 years and younger, should alwaysride in
the back seat properly restrained for their age
and size. The airbag on the passenger side makes
the front seat a potentially dangerous place for a
child to ride. The front seat is not the safest place
for a child in a forward-facing child safety seat. It
can be a very dangerous place for an infant or a
larger child in a rearward-facing seat.

@) Tips

Always replace child restraints that were in-
stalled in a vehicle during a crash. Damage to
a child restraint that is not visible could cause

it to fail in another collision situation.

ONE Tee Reamee Maal Cele)

Your vehicle is equipped with an “Advanced Air-
bag System”in compliance with United States
Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS)
208, as well as Canada Motor Vehicle Safety
Standard (CMVSS) 208 as applicable at the time
your vehicle was manufactured.

The Advanced Airbag system in your vehicle has
been certified to meet the “low-risk” require-
mentsfor 3- and 6-year old children on the pas-
senger side and small adults on the driver side.
The low risk deployment criteria are intended to
reduce the risk of injury through interaction with
the airbag that can occur, for example, by being
too close to the steering wheel and instrument
panel when the airbag inflates. In addition, the
system has been certified to comply with the
“suppression” requirementsof the Safety Stand-
ard, to turn off the front airbag for infants up to
12 months who are restrained on the front pas-
senger seat in child restraints that are listed in
the Standard.

292

The capacitive passenger detection system regis-
ters the changes that result in an electrical field
when a child, a child restraint, and a baby blanket
are on the front passenger seat. The change in
the measured capacitance due to the presence of
a child, a child restraint, and a baby blanket on
the front passenger seat is related to the child re-
straint system resting on the seat. The measured
capacitance of a child restraint system varies de-
pending on the type of system and specific make
and model.

The electrical capacitance of the various types,
makes, and models of child restraints specified
by the U.S. National HighwayTraffic Safety Ad-
ministration (NHTSA)in the relevant safety
standard are stored in the Advanced Airbag Sys-
tem control unit together with the capacitances
typical of infants and a 1-year old child. When a
child restraint is used on the front passenger seat
with a typical 1 year-old infant, the Advanced Air-
bag System compares the capacitance measured
by the capacitive passenger detection system
with the data stored in the electronic control
unit.

Cea eReite cea Wahite Way led

Regardless of the child restraint that you use,
makesure that it has been certified to meet Safe-
ty Standards and has been certified by its manu-
facturer for use with an airbag. Always be sure
that the child restraint is properly installed at

Many types and models of child restraints have
been available over the years, new modelsarein-
troduced regularly incorporating new and im-
proved designs and older modelsare taken out of
production. Child restraints are not standardized.
Child restraints of the same type typically have
different weights and sizes and different “foot-
prints”, the size and shape of the bottom of the
child restraint that sits on the seat, when they
are installed on a vehicle seat. These differences
makeit virtually impossible to certify compliance
with the requirements for advanced airbags with
each and every child restraint that has ever been
sold in the past or will be sold over the course of
the useful life of your vehicle.

For this reason, the United States National High-
wayTraffic Safety Administration has published a

— All vehicle occupants and especially children
mustbe restrained properly whenever riding
in a vehicle. An unrestrained or improperly
restrained child could be injured by striking
the interior or by being ejected from the ve-

and not next to or in front of the child re-
straint so that the safety belt will be prop-
erly positioned.

— Always makesure that nothing prevents

the front passenger's seat from being
moved to the rearmostposition in its fore
and aft adjustment range.

— Always makesure that the backrestis in

the upright position.

— Never place or use anyelectrical device
(such as a laptop, CD player, electronic

gamesdevice, power inverter or seat heat-
er for child seats) on the front passenger
seat if the device is connected to the 12-
volt socket or the cigarette lighter socket.

— If a seat heater has been retrofitted or

otherwise added to the front passenger
seat, never install any child restraint sys-
tem on this seat.

Never install rear-facing child safety seats or
infant carriers on the front passenger seat.
A child will be seriously injured and can be
killed when the passenger airbag inflates -
even with an Advanced Airbag System.
The inflating airbag will hit the child safety
seat or infant carrier with great force and
will smash the child safety seat and child
against the backrest, center armrest, door
or roof.
Alwaysinstall rear-facing child safety seats
or infant carriers on the rear seat.
Before you carry a child in a rear-facing child
safety seat on the rear seat, remove the
Rear Seat Entertainment (RSE)* and its
holder* from the backrest of the front seat.
Makesure there is enough spacein front of
the child in the child seat. If necessary, ad-
just the angle and position of the seat in
front of the child seat.
Forward-facing child safety seats installed
on the front passenger's seat can interfere
with the airbag when it inflates and cause
serious injury to the child. Alwaysinstall for-
ward-facing child safety seats on the rear
seat.
If exceptional circumstances require the use
of a forward-facing child restraint on the
front passenger's seat, the child's safety and
well-being require that the following special
precautions be taken:

The vehicle's safety belts alone will not fit most
children until they are at least 4 ft. 9 in. (57 in-
ches/1.45 meters) tall and weigh about 80 lbs.

that the safety belt will pass properly over the
stronger parts of their bodies and the safety belt
can help protect them in acrash.

to restrain any child, regardless of how big the
child is. Always remember that children do not
have the pronounced pelvic structure required for
the proper function of lap belt portion of the ve-
hicle's three point lap and shoulder belts. The
child's safety absolutely requires that a lap belt
portion of the safety belt be fastened snugly and
as low as possible around the pelvis. Never let
the lap belt portion of the safety belt pass over
the child's stomach or abdomen.

> Do not use the convertible locking retractor

when using the vehicle's safety belt to restrain
a child on a booster seat.

> The shoulder belt mustlie as close to the cen-

ter of the child’s collar bone as possible and
mustlie flat and snug on the upper body.It
must never lie across the throat or neck. The
lap belt mustlie across the pelvis and never
across the stomach or abdomen. Makesure the
belt lies flat and snug. Pull on the belt to tight-
en if necessary.

> If you must transport an older child in a boos-

ter seat on the front passenger seat, you can
use the safety belt height adjustment to help

> Secure unused safety belts on the rear seat

=> page 296.

Children up to at least 8 years old (over 40 lbs. or
18 kg) are best protected in child safety seats de-
signed for their age and weight. Experts say that
the skeletal structure, particularly the pelvis, of
these children is not fully developed, and they
must notuse the vehicle safety belts without a
suitable child restraint.

It is usually best to put these children in appro-
priate booster seats. Be sure the booster seat
meetsall applicable safety standards.

Booster seats raise the seating position of the
child and reposition both the lap and shoulder
parts of the safety belt so that they pass across
the child's body in the right places. The routing of
the belt over the child's bodyis very important
for the child's protection, whether or not a boos-
ter seat is used. Children age 12 and under must
alwaysride in the rear seat.

Children who areatleast 4 ft. 9 in. (57 inches/
1.45 meters) tall can generally use the vehicle's
three point lap and shoulder belts. Never use the
lap belt portion of the vehicle's safety belt alone

In acrash, airbags mustinflate within a blink of
an eye and with considerable force. In order to do
its job, the airbag needs room toinflate so that it
will be there to protect the occupant as the occu-
pant moves forward into the airbag.

A vehicle occupant who is out of position and too
close to the airbag gets in the wayof an inflating
airbag. When an occupant is too close, he or she
will be struck violently and will receive serious or
possibly even fatal injury.

In order for the airbag to offer protection, it is
important that all vehicle occupants, especially
any children, who mustbe in the front seat be-
cause of exceptional circumstances, be properly
restrained and as far away from the airbag as
possible. By keeping room between the child's
body and the front of the passenger compart-
ment,the airbag can inflate completely and pro-
vide supplemental protection in certain frontal
collisions.

 ZA WARNING
Not using a booster seat, using the booster
seat improperly, incorrectly installing a boos-
ter seat or using the vehicle safety belt im-
properly increases the risk of serious personal
injury and deathin a collision or other emer-
gencysituation. To help reduce the risk of se-
rious personal injury and/or death:
— The shoulder belt mustlie as close to the

 
  

center of the child’s collar bone as possible
and mustlie flat and snug on the upper
body. It must never lie across the throat or
neck. The lap belt mustlie across the pelvis
and never across the stomach or abdomen.
Makesurethe belt lies flat and snug. Pull on
the belt to tighten if necessary.

Securing a child safety seat using a safety
Praha

Safety belts for the rear seats and the front pas-
senger can be locked with the convertible locking
retractor to properly secure child safety seats.

The safety belts for the rear seats and for the
front passenger’s seat have a convertible locking
retractor for child safety seats. The safety belt
mustbe locked so that belt webbing cannot un-
reel. The retractor can be activated to lock the
safety belt and prevent the safety belt webbing
from loosening up during normal driving. A child
safety seat can only be properly installed when
the safety belt is locked so that the child and
child safety seat will stay in place.

Always remember: Even though your vehicleis
equipped with an Advanced Airbag system, all
children, especially those 12 years and younger,
should alwaysride in the back seat properly re-
strained for their age and size.

Use the convertible locking retractor to secure a
child restraint.

Always heed the child safety seat manufacturer's
instructions when installing a child restraint in
your vehicle. To activate the convertible locking
retractor:

> Place the child restraint on a seat, preferably on

the rear seat.

> Slowly pull the belt all the way out.
> Route it around or through the child restraint

belt path > A\.

> Push the child safety seat down with your full

weight to get the safety belt really tight.

> Insert the belt tongue into the buckle for that

seating position.

> Guide the safety belt back into the retractor un-
til the belt lies flat and snug on the child safety
seat.

> You should hear a “clicking” noise as the belt
winds back into the inertia reel. Test the con-

vertible locking retractor by pulling on the belt.
You should no longer be ableto pull the belt
out of the retractor. The convertible locking re-
tractor is now activated.

> Make sure that the red release button is facing
away from the child restraint so that it can be
unbuckled quickly.

> Pull on the belt to make sure the safety beltis

properly tight and fastened so that the seat
cannot move forward or sideways more than

one inch (2.5 cm).

 ZA WARNING

Using the wrong child restraint or an improp-
erly installed child restraint can cause serious
personal injury or death in a crash.
— Always makesure that the safety belt retrac-

tor is locked when installing a child safety
seat. An unlocked safety belt retractor can-
not hold the child safety seat in place during
normal driving or in a crash.

— Always buckle the child safety seat firmly in

place even if a child is not sitting in it. A
loose child safety seat can fly around during
a sudden stop or ina crash.

— Always make sure the seat backrest to which

the child restraint is installed is in an up-
right position and securely latched into
place and cannotfold forward. Otherwise,
the seatback with the child safety seat at-
tached to it could fly forward in the event of
an accident or other emergencysituation.

The convertible locking retractor for child re-
straints will be deactivated automatically when
the belt is wound all the way backinto the re-

tractor.

> Press the red button on the safety belt buckle.

The belt tongue will pop out of the buckle.

> Guide the safety belt all the way back intoits

stowed position.

Alwayslet the safety belt retract completely into
its stowed position. The safety belt can now be
used as an ordinary safety belt without the con-
vertible locking retractor for child restraints.

If the convertible locking retractor should be ac-
tivated inadvertently, the safety belt must be un-
fastened and guided completely back intoits
stowed position to deactivate this feature. If the
convertible locking retractor is not deactivated,
the safety belt will gradually become tighter and
uncomfortable to wear.

 Z\ WARNING

Improperly installed child safety seats in-
crease the risk of serious personal injury and

LATCH system (Lower
anchorages and tethers
for children)

Child Restraint System anchors and how
are they related to child safety

To provide a simpler and more practicable way to
attach the child restraint on the vehicle seat, Fed-
eral regulations require special lower anchorages
in vehicles and devices on new child restraints to
attach to the vehicle anchorages.

In the United States, the combination of the
tether anchorages and the lower anchorages is
nowgenerally called the LATCH system for
“Lower Anchoragesand Tethersfor Children”. In
Canada, the terms “top tether” with “lower uni-
versal anchorages”(or “Lower universal anchor-
age bars”) are used to describe the system.

In other countries the term “ISOFIX”is used to
describe the lower anchorages.

Forward-facing child restraints manufactured af-
ter September 1, 1999, are required by U.S. fed-
eral regulations to comply with new child head
movement performance requirements. These
new performance requirements make a tether
necessary on most newchild seats.

Installing a child restraint that requires a top
tether without one can seriously impair the per-
formance of the child restraint and its ability to
protect the child in a collision. Installing a child
restraint that requires a top tether without the
top tether may be a violation of state law.

Child restraint manufacturers offer LATCH lower
anchorages on their child seats with hook-on or
push-on connectors attached to adjustable

straps.

In addition to the LATCH lower anchorages, these
child restraint systems usually require the use of
tether straps to help keep the child restraint
firmly in place.

 ZA WARNING
Improper installation of child restraints will
  
 
increase the risk of injury and death inacrash.

Child safety

— Alwaysfollow the instructions provided by
the manufacturer of the child restraint you
intend to install in your vehicle.

— Never install a child restraint without a

properly attached top tether strap if the
child restraint manufacturer's instructions
require the top tether strap to be used.

— Improper useofchild restraint LATCH lower
anchorage points can lead toinjury in a colli-
sion. The LATCH lower anchorage points are
designed to withstand only those loads im-
posed bycorrectly fitted child restraints.

— Never mounttwochild restraint systems on

one LATCH lower anchorage point.

— Never secure or attach any luggage or other

item to the LATCH lower anchorages.

@ Tips

Fuel

ahem elt)

The vehicle maybe filled with fuel that has a
higher octane rating than whatis required by
the engine.

The correct gasoline gradeis stated on the inside
of the fuel filler door.

Gasoline mixture

The vehicle is equipped with a catalytic converter
and mustonly be driven with unleaded gasoline.

Gasoline with alcohol or MTBE (Methyl-Tert-
Butyl-Ether)

Audi recommends using TOP TIER Detergent Gas-
oline. For additional information on TOP TIER De-
tergent Gasoline, visit www.toptiergas.com.

The individual gasoline grades are differentiated
by octane ratings. This value is given with (R
+M)/2 equating to AKI or in RON.

The headings below match the sticker in the fuel
filler door.

UNLEADED FUEL ONLYMIN. (R+M)/2 87
Regular / MIN. RON 91 Regular

Use regular gasoline with minimum 87 AKI /

The maximum engine power is only reached if
premium gasoline 91 AKI / 95 RON is used.

UNLEADED FUEL ONLY PREMIUM MIN. (R
+M)/2 91 / SUPER MIN. RON 95

You can use unleaded gasoline mixed with alco-
hol or MTBE (generally labeled as oxygenated
compounds)as long as the fuel meets the follow-
ing conditions:

Gasoline with methanol content (methylalco-
hol or methanol)

— Anti-Knock Indexis at least 87 AKI

—No more than 3% methanol

— More than 2% solvent

Gasoline with ethanol content (ethyl alcohol or
ethanol)

— Anti-Knock Indexis at least 87 AKI

—No more than 15% ethanol

Gasoline with MTBE content

— Anti-Knock Index is at least 87 AKI

—No more than 15% MTBE

Gasoline adapted to the season

Using premium gasoline with minimum 91 AKI /
95 RON is recommended.

If premium gasoline is not available, you can also
use regular gasoline 87 AKI / 91 RON. However
this does reduce the engine power slightly.

Manygasoline fuels are adapted to the seasons.
When the season changes, we recommend refu-
eling at high-traffic gas stations. It is morelikely
that the gasoline will be suitable for the season
there.

@) Note

() Note

— Filling the tank just one time with leaded
fuel or other metallic additives will cause
permanent deterioration to the catalytic
converter function.

— When gasoline with an octane rating that is
too low is used, high speeds or heavy engine
load can lead to engine damage.

Gasoline additives

An important issue for many automobile manu-
facturers is combustion residue in the engine
that results from the use of certain fuels.

Although typesof gasoline differ depending on
the manufacturer, there are similarities. Certain
substances in the gasoline may cause deposits in
the engine. Additives in the gasoline that should
keep the engine and fuel system clean do notall
function equally.

Audi recommends using TOP TIER Detergent Gas-

— Mobile devices, radio devices, and other ra-

— If you do not insert the fuel pump nozzleall

the wayinto the filler tube, then fuel can
leak out. Spilled fuel can ignite and start a
fire.

— Never get into the vehicle when refueling. If

there is an exceptional situation where you
mustenter the vehicle, close the door and
touch a metal surface before touching the
fuel pump nozzle again. This will reduce the
risk of electrostatic discharge that can cause
flying sparks. Sparks can start a fire when
refueling.

 

 Z\ WARNING
Transporting fuel containers inside the vehicle
is not recommended. Fuel could leak out of
the container and ignite, especially during an

accident. This can cause explosions,fires, and
injuries.

 

 

 

er, note the following:

— Alwaysplace the fuel container on the

ground before filling. Never fill the fuel
container with fuel while it is inside or on
the vehicle. Electrostatic discharge can oc-
cur while refueling and the fuel vapors
could ignite.

— When using fuel containers made of met-
al, the fuel pump nozzle must always re-
main in contact with the container to re-
duce the risk of static charge.

— Insert the fuel pump nozzle as far as pos-

sible into the filler opening while refuel-
ing.

— Follow the applicable legal regulations in

the country whereyou are driving when
using, storing and transporting fuel con-
tainers.

— Makesure that the fuel container meets

the industry standards, for example ANSI
or ASTM F852-86.

 

 

 

() Note

— Removefuel that has overflowed onto any
vehicle components immediately to reduce
the risk of damage to the vehicle.

— Never drive until the fuel tank is completely

empty. The irregular supply of fuel that re-
sults from that can cause engine misfires.
Uncombusted fuel may enter the exhaust
system and increase the risk of damage to
the catalytic converter.

— Never spill fluids on a hot engine. These flu-

ids (such as the anti-freezing agent con-
tained in the coolant) can ignite.

— Avoid shortcircuits in the electrical system.
— Never reach into the radiator fan. The fan is

temperature-controlled and can turn on
suddenly, even when the ignition is switched
off.

— Never open the hood when there is steam or
coolant escaping from the engine compart-

ment, because thereis a risk that you could
be burned. Wait until no steam or coolant is
escaping.

— Never open the cap on the coolant expan-

sion tank when the engine is warm. The
cooling system is under pressure.

—To protect your face, hands, and arms from
hot steam or coolant, cover the cap with a
thick cloth when opening.

— Do not remove the engine cover under any

circumstances. This increases the risk of
burns.

— Due to the risk of electric shock, never touch

C) Note

If the engine oil level is too low or too high,
there is a risk of engine damage.

@ Tips

The oil level indicator in the display is only an
informational display. If the oil level is too
low, a minimum oil warning appearsin the in-
strumentcluster. Add oil and close the hood.
The current oil level is displayed in the Info-
tainment system the next time the ignition is
switched on.

G@) Tips

The engine oil consumption may be up to
0.5 quart/600 miles (0.5 liter/1,000 km), de-
pending on driving style and operating condi-
tions. Consumption maybe higher during the
first 3,000 miles (5,000 km). The engine oil
level must be checked regularly. It is best to
check each time you refuel your vehicle and
before long drives.
— Because of the lubrication and cooling of
the engine, combustion engines consume
oil. The oil consumption varies depending
on the engine and may change during the
service life of the engine. Engines generally
consume moreoil at the beginning during
the break-in period. Then oil consumption
stabilizes after the break-in period.

nents.

— Under normal conditions, oil consumption
depends on the quality and viscosity of the
oil, the engine RPM, the climate conditions,
and the road conditions. The dilution of oil

from condensation or fuel residue as well as
the age ofthe oil also play a role. Because
engine wear increases with mileage, oil con-
sumption will increase again over time until
it may be necessary to replace worn compo-

— Becauseall these variables play a role, it is
not possible to define an oil consumption

standard. Therefore, the oil level must be
checked regularly.

— If you believe that your engine has in-

creased its oil consumption, contact an au-

thorized Audi dealer or authorized Audi
Service Facility to determine the cause.
Please note that an exact oil consumption
measurement must be done with the neces-
sary care and accuracy and maytake time.
An authorized Audi dealer or authorized Au-
di Service Facility is trained in accurately
measuring the oil consumption.

@) Note

— The New Vehicle Limited Warranty does not
cover damage or malfunctions if the recom-
mended intended use of the vehicle and
maintenance measures listed in the Audi
Owner's Manual and the Warranty & Main-
tenance Booklet were not followed.

— Only use high-grade engine oil that explicit-

ly meets the Audi oil quality standard for
your vehicle. Using another oil may cause
severe vehicle damage.

— Do not mix any additional lubricants into

the engine oil. Damage caused by such addi-
tives is not covered by the warranty.

@ For the sake of the environment

— Oil should never enter the sewer system or

We recommend having the oil changed at an au-
thorized Audi dealer or authorized Audi Service
Facility.

Follow the safety precautions > page 313, Work-
ing in the engine compartment.

The engine oil must be changed at the intervals
specified in the Warranty & Maintenance Book-
let. This is very important because the lubrication
function of the oil gradually declines during regu-
lar vehicle operation.

The engine oil should be changed morefrequent-
ly under certain circumstances. Havethe oil
changed more frequently if you often drive short
distances, your vehicle is predominantly in stop-
and-go traffic situations,is in very dusty environ-
ments, or is operated for long periods of time in
temperatures below zero.

Cleansing additives in the oil makefresh oil ap-
pear darker after the engine has run briefly. This
is normal and no reason to change the engine oil
more frequently than recommended.

Becausecorrectly disposing of engine oil is diffi-
cult and special tools and technical knowledge
are needed for an oil change, having your engine
oil changed by an authorized Audi dealer or au-
thorized Audi Service Facility is recommended to
have your engine oil changed by an authorized.

If you change the engine oil yourself, please note
the following important information:

 Z\ WARNING

If you change the engine oil on the vehicle
yourself, the following precautions must be
followed:
— Wear protective eyewear.
— Due to the risk of scalding, allow the engine

to cool downsufficiently.

 
  

— Maintain enough distance when you are re-
moving the oil drain plug. While doing this,

— Engine oil is poisonous. Always store out of

— Prolonged contact of used engine oil with

 
  

the skin may cause skin damage. Always
wash oil off immediately with soap and wa-

ter to protect your skin.

@) Note

Do not mix any additives with the engine oil.
Additives may cause engine damage that is
not covered by your New Vehicle Limited War-

ranty.

@ For the sakeof the environment

— Before changing the engine oil, make sure
you can disposeof the used engine oil cor-
rectly.

— Engine oil must always be disposed of cor-

rectly. Do not dump it in the yard, in the for-
est, or in open water, river channels, or sew-
ers.

— Have your used engine oil recycled by bring-
ing it to a used oil collection site or contact
a gas station.

Cooling system

The engine cooling system is filled with a mixture
of purified water and coolant additive at the fac-
tory. This coolant must not be not changed.

The coolant level is monitored through the B in-
dicator light > page 21. However, occasionally
checking the coolant level manually is recom-
mended.

If you must add coolant, use a mixture of water
and coolant additive. Mixing the coolant additive
with distilled water is recommended.

tions in the engine compartment
=> page 323.

C) Note

— Ahighly explosive mixture of gases can form

when charging batteries. Only charge the
battery in well-ventilated areas.

— A drained battery can freeze at tempera-

tures around 32 9F (0 2C). Do not charge or
use a frozen or thawed battery. If ice forms,
the battery housing can crack and battery
electrolyte can leak out, which increases the

 
  

risk of an explosion and chemical burns.
Contact an authorized Audi dealer or author-
ized Audi Service Facility for more informa-
tion.

— Do not connector disconnect the charging
cable while charging becausethis increases
the risk of an explosion.

G) Tips

Read all of the manufacturer's instructions
for the charger before charging the battery.

Windshield washer
system

 

— The concentration of anti-freezing agent
must be adjusted to the vehicle operating
conditions and the climate. A concentration
that is too high can lead to vehicle damage.

— Never add radiator anti-freeze or other addi-

tives to the washer fluid.

— Do not use a glass cleaner that contains

paint solvents, becausethis could damage
the paint.

Wheels and Tires

General information

> Check your tires regularly for

damage, such as punctures,

cuts, cracks, and bulges. Remove
foreign objects from the tire
tread.
>If driving over curbs or similar
obstacles, drive slowly and ap-
proach the curb at an angle.
> Have faulty tires or rims re-

placed immediately.

>Protect your tires from oil,

grease, and fuel.

>Mark tires before removing
them so that the same running
direction can be maintained if
they are reinstalled.
>Lay tires flat when storing and

store them ina cool, dry location
with as little exposureto light as
possible.

 

A WARNING

—Never drive faster than the

maximum permitted speed for
your tires. This could cause the
tires to heat up too much. This

 
  

tire to burst.

increases the risk of an acci-

dent because it can cause the

326

 

—Always adapt your driving to

the road and traffic condi-
tions. Drive carefully and re-
duce your speed on icyor slip-

pery roads. Even winter tires
can lose traction on black ice.

 

 

 

() Note

—Please note that summer and
winter tires are designed for
the conditions that are typical
in those seasons. Audi recom-
mends using winter tires dur-
ing the winter months. Low
temperatures significantly de-
crease the elasticity of summ-

er tires, which affects traction
and braking ability. If summer
tires are used in very cold tem-

peratures, cracks can form on

the tread bars, resulting in
permanent tire damage that
can cause loud driving noise
and unbalanced tires.

—Burnished, polished or

chromed rims must not be
used in winter driving condi-
tions. The surface of the rims
does not have sufficient corro-
sion protection for this and
could be permanently dam-
aged byroad salt or similar
substances.

Newtires or wheels

Audi recommends having all work
on tires or wheels performed by
an authorized Audi dealer or au-
thorized Audi Service Facility.
These facilities have the proper
knowledge and are equipped with
the required tools and replace-
ment parts.

>Newtires do not yet have the

optimum gripping properties.
Drive carefully and at moderate
speeds for the first 350 miles
(500 km) with newtires.
> Only use tires with the same de-

sign, size (rolling circumfer-

ence), and as close to the same
tread pattern as possible on all
four wheels.
>Do notreplace tires individually.
At least replace both tires on the
same axle at the same time.

same size > A.

>If you would like to equip your
vehicle with a tire and rim com-
bination that is different from
what was installed at the facto-
ry, consult with an authorized
Audi dealer or authorized Audi
Service Facility before making a
purchase > A.

Because the sparetire” is differ-
ent from the regular tires instal-
led on the vehicle (such as winter

tires or wide tires), only use the
sparetire* temporarily in case of
emergency and drive carefully
while it is in use. It should be re-
placed with a regular tire as soon
as possible.

All four wheels must be equipped
with tires that are the same brand
and have the same construction
and tread pattern so that the
drive system is not damaged by
different tire speeds. For this rea-
son, in case of emergency, only
use a Sparetire* that is the same
circumference as the regular tires.
 Z\ WARNING
—Do not use steel rims that are
 
  

17 inches or larger. Otherwise,

334

 

damage to the vehicle and an
accident could result.

—Only use tire/rim combina-

tions and suitable wheel bolts
that have been approved by

Audi. Otherwise, damage to
the vehicle and an accident
could result.

—For technical reasons, it is not
possible to use tires from oth-
er vehicles. In some cases, you
cannot even use tires from the
same vehicle model.

—Makesurethat the tires you

select have enough clearance
to the vehicle. Replacement
tires should not be chosen
simply based on the nominal

size, because tires with a dif-
ferent construction can differ

vehicle components could wear
more quickly.

Treadwear indicator

Original equipment tires contain
treadwear indicators in the tread

pattern, which are bars that are
1/16 in (1.6 mm) high and are
spaced evenly around the tire per-
pendicular to the running direc-
tion > fig. 269. The letters “TWI”

—Overloading can lead to loss of

vehicle control and increase

the risk of an accident. Read

 

 

 

 

and follow the important safe-
ty precautions in > page 338,
Tires and vehicle load limits.

—The tire must flex moreif the

tire pressureis too low or if
the vehicle speed or load are
too high. This heats the tire up
too much. This increases the
risk of an accident because it
can cause the tire to burst and
result in loss of vehicle con-

Tires and vehicle load limits

There are limits to the amount of
load or weight that any vehicle

338

that is overloaded will not handle
well and is moredifficult to stop.
Overloading can not only lead to

loss of vehicle control, but can al-
so damage important parts of the
vehicle and can lead to sudden

tire failure, including a blowout

and sudden deflation that can

cause the vehicle to crash.

Your safety and that of your pas-
sengers also depends on making
sure that load limits are not ex-
ceeded. Vehicle load includes ev-
erybody and everything in and on
the vehicle. These load limits are
technically referred to as the vehi-
cle’s Gross Vehicle Weight Rating

(“GVWR”).

The “GVWR”includes the weight

of the basic vehicle, all factory in-

stalled accessories, a full tank of

fuel, oil, coolant and other fluids
plus maximum load. The maxi-
mum load includes the number of
passengersthat the vehicleis in-
tended to carry (“seating capaci-
ty”) with an assumed weight of
150 lbs. (68 kg) for each passen-
ger at a designated seating posi-
tion and the total weight of any
luggage in the vehicle. If you tow

a trailer, the weight of the trailer
hitch and the tongue weight of
the loaded trailer must be includ-
ed as part of the vehicle load.

The Gross Axle Weight Rating
(“GAWR’”) is the maximum load
that can be applied at each of the
vehicle’s two axles.

The fact that there is an upper
limit to your vehicle’s Gross Vehi-

cle Weight Rating means that the
total weight of whatever is being
carried in the vehicle (including
the weight of a trailer hitch and
the tongue weight of the loaded
trailer) is limited. The more pas-
sengersin the vehicle or passen-
gers who are heavier than the
standard weights assumed mean
that less weight can be carried as
luggage.

The Gross Vehicle Weight Rating
and the Gross Axle Weight Rating
are listed on the safety compli-

ance sticker label located on the
driver’s side B-pillar.

 

Z\ WARNING
Overloading a vehicle can cause

loss of vehicle control, a crash

or other accident, serious per-
sonal injury, and even death.
—Carrying more weight than

your vehicle was designed to

Determining correct load
limit

Use the example below to calcu-
late the total weight of the pas-
sengers and luggage or other
things that you plan to transport
so that you can make sure that
your vehicle will not be overload-
ed.

Steps for Determining Correct
Load Limit

1. Locate the statement “THE

weight of the driver and pas-
sengers that will be riding in
your vehicle.

. Subtract the combined weight

of the driver and passengers
from “XXX” kilograms or “XXX”
pounds shown on the stick-
er> page 336,fig. 271.

. The resulting figure equals the
available amount of cargo and
uggage load capacity. For ex-

ample, if the “XXX” amount
equals 1400 lbs. and there will
be five 150 lbs. passengersin

your vehicle, the amount of
available cargo and luggage
oad capacity is 650 lbs.
(1400-750 (5 x 150) = 650
bs.)

. Determine the combined

 

weight of luggage and cargo
being loaded on the vehicle.
That weight may not safely ex-

Wheel bolts and rims

Wheel bolts

Wheel bolts must be clean and loosen/tighten
easily.

Rims

Rims with a bolted rim ring* or with bolted wheel
covers* consist of multiple pieces. These compo-
nents were bolted together using special bolts
and a special procedure. You mustnotrepair or
disassemble them > A\.

 ZA\ WARNING
Wheel bolts that are tightened or repaired in-
correctly can become loose and result in loss
of vehicle control, which increases the risk of
an accident. For the correct tightening specifi-
cation, see > page 358,Finishing.

> Please note that the maximum permitted

speed may be lower with wintertires > A\ in
General information on page 326. An author-
ized Audi dealer or authorized Audi Service Fa-
cility can inform you about the maximum per-
mitted speed for your tires.

> Check the tire pressure after installing wheels

=> page 336.

The effectiveness of winter tires is reduced great-
ly when the tread is worn down to a depth of
0.16 in (4 mm). The characteristics of winter tires
also decrease greatly as the tire ages, regardless
of the remaining tread.

@) For the sake of the environment

Reinstall summer tires at the appropriate
time, because they provide better handling
when roads are free of snow and ice. Summer

tires cause less road noise,tire wear, and fuel
consumption.

@ Tips

You can also use all season tires instead of

winter tires. Please note that in some coun-
tries where winter tires are required, only win-
ter tires with the 44 symbol may be permit-
ted.

Snowchains improve bothdriving and braking in
winter road conditions.

> Only install snow chains on the front wheels.
> Check and correct the seating of the snow

chains after driving a few feet, if necessary. Fol-
low the instructions from the manufacturer.

> Note the maximum speed of 30 mph

(50 km/h). Observe the local regulations.

 

— Always keep the wheel bolts and the threads

in the wheel hub clean and free of grease.

— Only use wheel bolts thatfit the rim.

— Always have damagedrims repaired by an
authorized Audi dealer or authorized Audi
Service Facility. Never repair or disassemble

rims yourself, because this increases the risk
of an accident.

 

 

Winter tires significantly improve the vehicle's
handling when driving in winter conditions. Be-
cause of their construction (width, compound,

tread pattern), summer tires provide less traction
on ice and snow.

Use of snow chains is only permitted with certain
rim/tire combinations due to technical reasons.
Check with an authorized Audi dealer or author-
ized Audi Service Facility to see if you may use
snowchains.

You must remove the snow chains on roads with-
out snow. Otherwise, you could impair driving
ability and damage the tires.

 

ZA\ WARNING

Using incorrect snow chains or installing snow
chains incorrectly can result in loss of vehicle
control, which increasesthe risk of an acci-
dent.

 
  

@) Note

— Snow chains can damage the rims and

wheel covers* if the chains come into direct
contact with them. Remove the wheel cov-
ers* first. Use coated snow chains.

— Do notinstall and use snow chains if thereis

a malfunction in the air suspension”, be-
cause the vehicle height will be very low.If
you drive with snow chains anyway, the
wheel housings and other vehicle compo-
nents can be severely damaged.

G) Tips

When using snow chains, it may be advisable
to limit the ESC > page 147.

Low-profile tires

Appliesto: vehicles with low-profile tires

Compared to other tire/rim combinations, low-
profile tires offer a wider tread surface and a
larger rim diameter with shorter tire sidewalls.
This results in an agile driving style. However,it
may reduce the level of comfort and increase
road noise when driving on roads in poor condi-
tion.

Low-profile tires can become damaged more
quickly than standard tires when driving over
large bumps, potholes, manhole covers, and

curbs. Therefore, it is particularly important to
maintain the correct tire pressure > page 336.

To reduce the risk of damage tothe tires and
rims, drive very carefully on poor roads.

After a heavy impact or damage, have the tires
and rims inspected or replaced immediately by
an authorized Audi dealer or authorized Audi
Service Facility.

Low-profile tires can wear out faster than stand-
ard tires.

Uniform tire quality grading

— Tread wear

— Traction AAABC

— Temperature A BC

Quality grades can be found where applicable on
the tire side wall between tread shoulder and
maximum section width > page 327, fig. 268.

For example: Tread wear 200, Traction AA, Tem-

perature A.

All passenger car tires must conform to Federal
Safety Requirements in addition to these grades.

Tread wear

The tread weargrade is a comparative rating
based on the wear rate of the tire when tested
under controlled conditions on aspecified gov-

ernment test course.

For example, a tire graded 150 would wear one
and one half (1 1/2) times as well on the govern-
ment course as a tire graded 100.

The relative performance of tires depends upon

the actual conditions of their use, however, and
maydepart significantly from the norm due to
variations in driving habits, service practices and
differences in road characteristics and climate.

Traction

The traction grades, from highest to lowest, are
AA, A, Band C. Those grades represent the tire's
ability to stop on wet pavement as measured un-
der controlled conditions on specified govern-
ment test surfaces of asphalt and concrete. A tire
marked C may have poor traction performance
SA.

Check your wheels regularly every 2,000 mi

(3,000 km) for damage. For example, check for
bulges/cracks on the tires or deformations/cracks
on the rims.

Temperature

The temperature grades are A (the highest), B,
and C, representing the tire's resistance to the

generation of heat and its ability to dissipate
heat when tested under controlled conditions on
a specified indoor laboratory test wheel.

Sustained high temperature can cause the mate-
rial of the tire to degenerate and reduce tirelife,
and excessive temperature can lead to sudden
tire failure > A.

The grade C corresponds to a level of perform-
ance which all passenger car tires must meet un-
der the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard
No. 109. Grades B and A represent higher levels
of performanceon the laboratory test wheel than
the minimum required by law.

 Z\ WARNING

The traction grade assignedtothis tire is
based on straight-ahead braking traction
tests, and does notinclude acceleration, cor-
nering, hydroplaning or peak traction charac-
teristics.

 

 ZA WARNING
The temperature grade for this tire is estab-
lished for a tire that is properly inflated and

 

not overloaded. Excessive speed, underinfla-
tion, or excessive loading, either separately or
in combination, can cause heat buildup and
possibletire failure.

  
 

 ZX WARNING
Temperature grades applyto tires that are
properly inflated and not over or underinflat-
ed.

Tire pressure monitoring
system

()) General notes

Each tire, including the spare(if provided),
should be checked monthly when cold and inflat-
ed to the inflation pressure recommended by the
vehicle manufacturer on the vehicle placard or
tire inflation pressure label. (If your vehicle has
tires of a different size than the size indicated on
the vehicle placardor tire inflation pressure la-

bel, you should determine the proper tire infla-
tion pressurefor thosetires).

As an added safety feature, your vehicle has been
equipped with a tire pressure monitoring system
(TPMS)thatilluminates a low tire pressure tell-
tale when one or moreof your tires is significant-
ly under-inflated. Accordingly, when the lowtire
pressuretelltale illuminates, you should stop and
check your tires as soon as possible, and inflate
them to the proper pressure. Driving on asignifi-
cantly under-inflated tire causes the tire to over-
heat and can lead totire failure. Under-inflation
also reduces fuel efficiency and tire tread life,
and may affect the vehicle's handling and stop-
ping ability.

Please note that the TPMS is not a substitute for

proper tire maintenance, and it is the driver's re-
sponsibility to maintain correct tire pressure,
even if under-inflation has not reached the level
to trigger illumination of the TPMS low tire pres-
suretelltale.

Your vehicle has also been equipped with a TPMS
malfunction indicator to indicate when the sys-
tem is not operating properly. The TPMS mal-
function indicator is combined with the low tire
pressure telltale. When the system detects a
malfunction, the telltale will flash for approxi-
mately one minute and then remain continuously
illuminated. This sequence will continue upon
subsequentvehicle start-ups as long as the mal-
function exists.

When the malfunction indicator is illuminated,
the system maynot be able to detect or signal
low tire pressure as intended. TPMS malfunctions
mayoccur for a variety of reasons, including the
installation of replacement or alternate tires or
wheels on the vehicle that prevent the TPMS
from functioning properly. Always check the
TPMS malfunction telltale after replacing one or
moretires or wheels on your vehicle to ensure
that the replacement or alternate tires and
wheels allow the TPMS to continue to function
properly.

The tire pressure indicator in the instrument
cluster informs you if the tire pressure is too low
or if there is a system malfunction.

Using the ABSsensors, the tire pressure monitor-
ing system comparesthe tire tread circumference
and vibration characteristics of the individual
tires. If the pressure changes in one or more
tires, this is indicated in the instrument cluster
display with an indicator light (J and a message.
If only one tire is affected, the location of that
tire will be indicated.

The tire pressures mustbe stored in the Infotain-

Run-flat tires
Applies to: vehicles with run-flat tires

Run-flat tires can allow you to remain driving
whenthereis a loss of pressure.

Run-flat tires have reinforced sidewalls that pro-
tect the tire if there is a loss of pressure.

If the tire pressure monitoring system indicates a
loss of pressure in one or several tires, you can
continue driving on run-flat tires for at least 20
miles (30 km). Drive to an authorized Audi dealer
or authorized Audi Service Facility immediately to
have the problem corrected.

Continuing to drive on run-flattires is no
longer possibleif:

— Thereis visible damage to the tires, such as

cracks in the sidewalls

— Strong vibrations are felt while driving, or the

tire begins to smoke due to a strong build-up of
heat

— The tire has been heavily damaged, for example

in an accident. Thereis a risk that parts of the
tire tread will detach and damage important
vehicle components.

— The Electronic Stabilization Control (ESC) is not

working or is continuously running

— The tire pressure monitoring system is not

working

If it is no longer possible to continue driving de-
spite having run-flat tires, see an authorized Audi
dealer or authorized Audi Service Facility for as-
sistance.

 ZA WARNING

Run-flat tires may only be used on vehicles
that were equipped with them at the factory.
— The vehicle must have suspension designed
for run-flat tires and a factory-installed tire
pressure monitoring system.

is not permitted.

— If you have to drive when the tire pressure is
too low or thereis no tire pressure, note the
following:

— Do not drive faster than 50 mph (80 km/h)

because this increases the risk of an acci-
dent. Observe any lawsspecific to the
country where you are driving.

— Avoid full-throttle acceleration, heavy

braking, and fast cornering, becausethis
increases the risk of an accident.

— The vehicle may become moredifficult to

control.

— See an authorized Audi dealer or author-
ized Audi Service Facility for assistance if
the tire is too heavily damaged.

— Have the faulty tires replaced and the rims
checked for damage by an authorized Audi
dealer or authorized Audi Service Facility.

— The driver is responsible for the vehicle, for

correcting the tire pressure, and for replac-
ing faulty parts. Therefore, always adjust
your driving to the current situation.

Care and cleaning

General information

Regular, proper care helps to maintain your vehi-
cle's value. It can also be a requirement when
submitting warranty claims for corrosion damage
and paint defects on the body.

The required cleaning and care products can be
obtained from an authorized Audi dealer or au-
thorized Service Facility. Read and follow the in-
structions for use on the packaging.

 ZA WARNING
— Using cleaning and care products incorrectly

can be dangerous to your health.

 
  

— Alwaysstore cleaning and care products out
of reach ofchildren to reducethe risk of poi-
soning.

@ For the sake of the environment

— Purchase environmentally-friendly cleaning

productsif possible.

— Do notdispose of cleaning and care prod-

ucts with household trash.

Car washes

The longer that deposits such as insects, bird
droppings, tree sap or road salt remain on the ve-
hicle, the more the surface can be damaged. High
temperatures such as those caused by sunlight
increase the damaging effect.

Before washing, rinse off heavy deposits with
plenty of water.

Stubborn deposits such as bird droppings or tree
sap are best removed with plenty of water anda
microfiber cloth.

Also, wash the underside of your vehicle once
road salt stops being used for the season.

Pressure washers

When washing your vehicle with a pressure wash-
er, always follow the operating instructions pro-
vided with the pressure washer.This is especially
important in regard to the pressure and spraying
distance. Do not aim the spraydirectly at the

346

seals on the side windows, doors, lids or the sun-
roof* or at tires, rubber hoses, insulating materi-

al, sensors* or camera lenses*. Keep a distance of
at least 16 in (40 cm).

Do not remove snowand ice with a pressure
washer.

Never use cone nozzles or high pressure nozzles.

The water temperature must not be above 140 °F
(60 °C).

Automatic car wash

Spray off the vehicle before washing.

Makesure that the windowsand roof* are closed
and the windshield wipersare off. Follow instruc-
tions from the car wash operator, especially if
there are accessories attached to your vehicle.

If possible, use car washes that do not have
brushes.

Washing by hand

Clean the vehicle starting from the top and work-
ing downward using a soft sponge or cleaning
brush. Use solvent-free cleaning products.

Washing vehicles with matte finish paint by
hand

To reduce the risk of damaging the paint when
washing, first remove dust and large particles
from your vehicle. Insects, grease spots, and fin-
gerprints are best removed with a special cleaner
for matte finish paint.

Apply the product using a microfiber cloth. To re-
duce the risk of damaging the paint surface, do
not use too much pressure.

Rinse the vehicle thoroughly with water. Then
clean using a neutral shampoo and asoft micro-
fiber cloth.

Rinse the vehicle thoroughly again and letit air
dry. Remove any water residue using a chamois.

The wheel bolts must be clean and loosen and
tighten easily. Check the contact surfaces for the
wheel and hub. Contaminants on these surfaces
must be removed before installing the wheel.

 Z\ WARNING

Never use the hex socket in the screwdriver
handle or the hex socket wrench with the
ratchet to loosen or tighten the wheel bolts.
You will not attain the required tightening
specification, which will increase the risk of an

 
  

accident.

CG) Note

When removing or installing the wheel, the
rim could hit the brake rotor and damage the
rotor. Work carefully and have a second per-
son help you.

(i) Tips

—When mounting tires with unidirectional

tread design makesure the tread patternis
pointed the right way > page 357.

— The wheel bolts should be clean and easy to

turn. Check for dirt and corrosion on the
mating surfaces of both the wheel and the
hub. Removeall dirt from these surfaces be-
fore remounting the wheel.

Unidirectional tires

A unidirectional tire profile is identified by arrows
on the tire sidewall that point in the running di-
rection. You must always maintain the specified
running direction. This is necessary to ensure the
tire's optimum performance in regard to adhe-
sion, running noise, and friction, and to reduce
the risk of hydroplaning.

To benefit fully from the advantages of the uni-
directional tire design, you should replace faulty
tires as soon as possible and restore the correct
running direction on all of the tires.

357

Emergency assistance

 

— Replace the flat tire with a new one and have

it installed on your vehicle as soon as possi-
ble. Remount the wheel cover.

Until then, drive with extra care and at reduced
speeds.

 Z\ WARNING
— If you are going to equip your vehicle with
tires or rims which differ from those which
were factory installed, then be sure to read
the information > page 333.

— Always makesure the damaged wheel or

even a flat tire and the jack* and tool kit are
properly secured in the luggage compart-
ment and are notloosein the passenger
compartment.

—Inan accident or sudden maneuver they

could fly forward, injuring anyone in the ve-
hicle.

 
  

Otherwise, in an accident or sudden maneu-
ver they could fly forward, causing injury to
passengersin the vehicle.

— Always store damaged wheel, jack* and

tools securely in the luggage compartment.

> Reinstall the caps on the wheel bolts if necessa-

ry.

> Store the vehicle tool kit in its designated

place.

> Store the replaced tire securely in the luggage

compartment > page 62.

> Check the tire pressure on the installed wheel

as soon as possible.

> Correct the tire pressure and store it in the In-

fotainment system > page 344.

> The wheel bolt tightening specification must be
120 ft lbs (160 Nm). Haveit checked it as soon
as possible with a torque wrench. Drive careful-
ly until then.

> Havethe faulty wheel replaced as quickly as

possible.

Gi) Tips

— If you notice that the wheel boltsare cor-

roded and difficult to turn while changing a
tire, they should be replaced before you
check the tightening torque.

— Drive at reduced speed until you have the

tightening torques checked.

Notes on wheel changing

Please read the information > page 333 if you
are going to use a replacement tire which is dif-
ferent from the tires on your vehicle.

After you change atire:

— Check the tire pressure on the replacement

tire immediately after installation.

— Have the wheel bolt tightening torque

checked with a torque wrench as soon as pos-
sible by your authorized Audi dealer or quali-
fied workshop.

— With steel and alloy wheel rims, the wheel
bolts are correctly tightened at a torque of
120 ft lbs (160 Nm).

— If you notice that the wheel bolts are corroded

and difficult to turn while changinga tire,
they should be replaced before you check the
tightening torque.

Due to the high electrical voltage, have the bulbs
replaced by a qualified technician. Headlights
with Xenon light are identified by the high volt-
age sticker.

LED headlights*

LED headlights require no maintenance. Please
contact your authorized Audi dealer if a bulb
needs to be replaced.

 

Z\ WARNING

Changing Xenon lampswithout the necessary
equipmentcan causeserious personal injury.

— Bulbs are pressurized and can explode when

being changed. Potential risk of injury!

— On vehicles equipped with gas discharge

bulbs (Xenon light)life-threatening injuries
can result from improper handling of the
high-voltage portions of such lamps!

— Only your authorized Audi dealer or quali-
fied workshop should change the bulbs in
gas discharge lamps. There are parts with
sharp edges on the openings and on the
bulb holders that can causeserious cuts. If

 
  

you are uncertain about what to do, have the
work performed by an authorized Audi deal-
er or qualified workshop. Serious personal
injury may result from improperly per-

formed work.

@ Tips

—If you still prefer to replace the light bulbs

yourself, be aware that the engine compart-
mentis a hazardous area to work in > A in
Working in the engine compartment on
page 313.

—It is best to ask your authorized Audi dealer

whenever you wantto change a bulb.

Bulbs

Replacing light bulbs

For your safety, we recommend that you have
your authorized Audidealer replace any bulbs for
you.

It is becoming increasingly more and morediffi-
cult to replace vehicle light bulbs since in many
cases, other parts of the car mustfirst be re-
moved before you are able to get to the bulb.
This applies especially to the light bulbs in the
front of your car which you can only reach
through the engine compartment.

Sheet metal and bulb holders can have sharp
edges that can cause serious cuts, parts must be
correctly taken apart and then properly put back
together to help prevent breakage of parts and
long term damage from water that can enter
housings that have not been properly resealed.

For your safety, we recommend that you have
your authorized Audi dealer replace any bulbs for
you, since your dealer has the proper tools, the
correct bulbs and the expertise.

creases the risk of an explosion and chemi-
cal burns. After jump starting the vehicle,
drive to an authorized Audi dealer or author-
ized Audi Service Facility immediately to
have the vehicle battery checked.

— Do not allow battery acid to contact eyes or

skin. Flush any contacted area with water
immediately.

— Improper use of a booster battery to start a

vehicle may cause an explosion.

— Vehicle batteries generate explosive gases.

Keep sparks, flame and lighted cigarettes
away from batteries.

— Do nottry to jump start anyvehicle with a

low acid level in the battery.

— The voltage of the booster battery must also

have a 12-Volt rating. The capacity (Ah) of
the booster battery should not be lower
than that of the discharged battery. Use of
batteries of different voltage or substantial-
ly different “Ah” rating may cause an explo-
sion and personal injury.

— Never charge a frozen battery. Gas trapped

in the ice may cause an explosion.

— Never charge or use a battery that has been
frozen. The battery case may have be weak-
ened.

— Use ofbatteries of different voltage or sub-
stantially different capacity (Ah) rating may
cause an explosion and injury. The capacity
(Ah) of the booster battery should not be
lower than that of the discharged battery.

— Before you check anything in the engine
compartment, always read and heed all
WARNINGS & page 313.

 

 

 

Emergencysituations

General

This chapter is intended for trained emergency
crews and working personnel whohave the nec-
essary tools and equipmentto perform these
operations.

Starting by pushing or
towing

@) Note

Vehicles with an automatic transmission
cannotbestarted by pushing or towing.

Starting with jumper
cables

If necessary, the engine can be started by con-
necting it to the battery of anothervehicle.

If the engine should fail to start because of a dis-
charged or weak battery, the battery can be con-
nected to the battery of another vehicle, using a
pair of jumper cablesto start the engine.

Jumper cables

Use only jumper cablesof sufficiently large cross
section to carry the starter current safely. Refer
to the manufacturer's specifications.

Use only jumper cables with insulated terminal
clamps which are distinctly marked:

plus (+) cable in most cases colored red

minus (-) cable in most cases colored black.

 Z\ WARNING

C) Note

Batteries contain electricity, acid, and gas.
Anyof these can cause very serious or fatal in-
jury. Follow the instructions below for safe
handling of your vehicle’s battery.
— Alwaysshield your eyes and avoid leaning

 
  

around 32 °F (0 °C). If the vehicle battery is
frozen, you must thawit before connecting
the jump start cables. If you do not,this in-

over the battery whenever possible.

— A dead battery can freeze at temperatures

364

— Applying a higher voltage booster battery
will cause expensive damage to sensitive
electronic components, such as control

units, relays, radio, etc.

— There must be no electrical contact between

the vehicles as otherwise current could al-
ready start to flow as soon as the positive

(+) terminals are connected.

 

Emergencysituations

@ Tips

The discharged battery must be properly con-
nected to the vehicle's electrical system.
When jump starting or charging the battery,
never connect the negative ground cable to
the battery negative post because the battery
manager system mustbe able to detect the
battery's state of charge. Always connect the
negative ground cable to the negative ground
post of the battery manager control unit.

drained battery @).

> If the engine does not start, stop the starting
procedure after 10 seconds and then repeatit
after approximately 30 seconds.

» Once the engine with the drained vehicle bat-

tery has been started, remove the cables in the
reverse order from the waythey wereinstalled.

> Close the red cover on the positive terminal.

The battery is vented to the outside to prevent
gases from entering the vehicle interior. Make
sure that the jumper clamps are well connected
with their metal parts in full contact with the
battery terminals.

 Z\ WARNING
To avoid serious personal injury and damage
to the vehicle, heed all warnings and instruc-
tions of the jumper cable manufacturer. If in
doubt,call for road service.

Driving in other
countries

Governmentregulations in the United States and
Canada require motor vehicles to comply with
emissions regulations and safety standards.
Therefore, vehicles that were produced for the
U.S. and Canadian marketsare different from ve-
hicles produced for other countries.

If you plan to use your vehicle outside of the
United States or Canada, it is possible that:

— Fuel may have a significantly lower octane rat-

ing. Unsuitable fuels can cause engine damage.

— Proper maintenance and repair work may not

be possible because special service equipment,
tools, or measuring devices needed for your ve-
hicle may not be available.

370

— Replacement parts may not always be availa-

ble.

— Navigation systems for vehicles built for the

U.S.A. and Canada will not necessarily work in
Europe, and may not work in other countries.

() Note

Audi is not liable for damage to the vehicle re-
sulting from these country-specific differen-
ces.

Maintenance, repairs,
and technical modifi-
cations

Note the safety precautions > page 313, Work-
ing in the engine compartment and © page 356,
Raising the vehicle.

General information

Due to the increasing complexity of technologyin

these vehicles, as well as the safety and environ-
mental standards that apply, you can only per-
form a very limited amount of repairs and modifi-
cations to the vehicle yourself.

Proof of maintenance work maybe required to
submit a claim within the warranty period.

We recommend that you have your vehicle serv-
iced by an authorized Audi dealer or authorized
Audi Service Facility and that Audi Genuine Parts
and Audi Genuine Accessories are used. This
helps to ensure that your vehicle's functionality,
performance, and safety are not impaired.

Maintenance and repairs

Your vehicle was designed to help keep mainte-
nance requirements to a minimum. Some regular
maintenanceis required to help ensure that your

vehicle runs in a safe, economical, and reliable
manner. Please refer to your Warranty & Mainte-

nance Booklet for more detailed information
about vehicle maintenance.

When operating the vehicle under more extreme
operating conditions, for example when outside

temperatures are very low or in very dusty envi-
ronments, certain maintenance should be per-
formed between the specified intervals.

 

Accessories and technical modifications

Usually maintenance and repair work requires
special tools, measuring devices, and other
equipment that is available to trained vehicle
technicians in order to help ensure that your vehi-
cle and all of its systems operate correctly, relia-
bly, and safely. Performing work on the vehicle
incorrectly can impair the operation and reliabili-
ty of your vehicle and mayvoid one or more of
your vehicle's warranties.

 

carry out the job and havethe correct tech-
nical information and the correct tools.

— If you are uncertain about what to do, have
the work performed by an authorized Audi
dealer, an authorized Audi Service Facility,

 
  

or another qualified workshop. Serious per-
sonal injury may result from improperly per-
formed work.

Technical Modifications

C) Note

Interference with electronic components,their
software, the wiring, and data transfer may cause
malfunctions. Because of the way electronic com-
ponentsare interconnected, such malfunctions
can also impair systems that are not directly in-
volved. This means that you risk both a substan-
tial reduction in the operational safety of your ve-
hicle and increased wear of vehicle components.

Some convenience functions, such as the conven-
ience turn signal function, individual door open-
ing function, and displays, can be reprogrammed
using special workshop equipment. If functions
are reprogrammed, the information and descrip-
tions about these functions in this Owner's Man-
ual may no longer apply to the changed func-
tions. Audi recommends that an authorized Audi
dealer or authorized Audi Service Facility perform
and verify any reprogramming procedures.

— Maintenance procedures,repairs or techni-
cal modifications that are performed incor-
rectly can cause damage to the vehicle, such
as corrosion.

— If emergency repairs must be performed,

take your vehicle to an authorized Audi deal-
er or authorized Audi Service Facility as soon
as possible.

— Audi is not liable for damage to the vehicle
resulting from failure to comply with these
guidelines.

@) For thesake of the environment

— Regular maintenance can help protect the

environment.

— Technical modifications to the vehicle can

have a negative impact on fuel consumption
and vehicle emissions.

 ZA WARNING

Reporting Safety Defects

Applicable to U.S.A.

If you believe that your vehicle
has a defect which could cause a
crash or could cause injury or
death, you should immediately in-
form the National HighwayTraffic
Safety Administration (NHTSA)in
addition to notifying

Audi of America, Inc.

2200 Ferdinand Porsche Drive

Herndon, VA 20171

If NHTSAreceives similar com-
plaints, it may open an investiga-
tion, and if it finds that a safety
defect exists in a group of vehi-

cles, it may order a recall and

remedy campaign. However,

NHTSAcannot become involved in
individual problems between you,

your dealer, or Audi of America,

Inc.

To contact NHTSA, you maycall
the Vehicle Safety Hotline toll-
free at 1-888-327-4236 (TTY: 1-
800-424-9153); go to http://
www.safercar.gov;

Service Facility, who will perform the work ac-
cording to Audi factory specifications. Only
Audi Genuine Parts are used when Audi ex-
perts perform repair or service procedures.
Failure to use Audi Genuine Parts or Audi Gen-
uine Accessories or performing repairs incor-
rectly may result in severe vehicle damage,
such as corrosion.

Accessories and parts

Consult with an authorized Audi dealer or author-
ized Audi Service Facility before purchasing ac-
cessories or replacement parts. We recommend
that you have your vehicle serviced by an author-
ized Audi dealer or authorized Audi Service Facili-
ty and that Audi Genuine Parts and Audi Genuine
Accessories are used.

Audi does not endorse the use of products and
accessories that it has not evaluated, even if the
productis approved by a certified testing agency
or government agency.

 ZX WARNING
— Installing unapproved accessories or incor-

rect replacement parts can cause vehicle
damage and can increase the risk of an acci-
dent.

— Never attach accessories, such as telephone
holders or cup holders, to the airbag covers
or within the airbag deploymentzone, be-
cause this increases the risk of injury if the
airbag deploys.

 
  

— Do not use a license plate bracket on the

front bumper that is different from the
bracketinstalled at the factory, and do not
attach any additional brackets.

©) Note

A correctly-installed exterior antenna is re-
quired for operating radio equipmentin the
